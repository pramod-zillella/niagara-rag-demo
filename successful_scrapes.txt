Although innovation is the key to our success at Niagara, our family tradition of high quality, value priced bottled water will never change. Niagara continues to grow and is the leading private label bottled water company in the United States.
Andrew Peykoff Sr. started bottling high quality low cost Niagara® water in five-gallon glass containers for home and office delivery in 1963. The Niagara tradition of quality, integrity, hard work and great customer service made Niagara a household name in Southern California.
In the early ‘90’s, Niagara expanded into offering single-serve private label bottled water for grocery, club store, convenience and wholesale customers with the same focus on offering an unmatched combination of quality, price and service.
Throughout the following decade, Niagara’s significant developments in vertical integration, innovative bottle design and high speed manufacturing positioned the company as the industry leading private label bottled water supplier in the Western United States.
Niagara’s family owned and operated status continued with Andy Peykoff II becoming President and CEO in 2002. Since then, Niagara has established itself as a National leader in high quality affordable bottled water with geographically diversified production facilities throughout the United States.
The dedication to operational improvements, a consistent recipe of hard work, integrity, attention to detail and the relentless quest for perfection has driven Niagara to become the largest family owned and operated bottled water company in the United States.
Much has changed since 1963; however the Niagara family tradition of high quality low cost bottled water has not.
From the Niagara family to yours we invite you to Taste the Pure Difference!®

Eco-Air Package®
As innovators, Niagara is always looking for ways to improve through technological advancements and processes that help us reduce our impact on the environment.
Our Eco-Air Package® eliminates the need for a cardboard tray completely and the cases take up less pallet space which allows us to ship more water per order and helps us reduce our CO
₂
emissions. The Eco-Air case wrap is also recyclable via Store Drop Off.
Eco-Air Bottle®
Niagara has reduced the amount of plastic in our Eco-Air® Bottle by over 60%*. Our bottle is lightweight and recyclable**. Because of the reduced weight in our plastic, we are able to:
Transport more water per truck load which reduces CO
2
emissions
Use less plastic per bottle which helps conserve valuable resources
Since 2009 Niagara has reduced the carbon footprint of its bottles by 59% through innovations in design, lightweighting and packaging.
In addition, we’ve reduced our label size and bottle cap size to further reduce our material use.
*On average vs. our original 1998 500mL bottle. **Recyclable bottle and cap. Excludes label and outer wrap, which may not be recyclable in your area.
Recycled Plastic Utilization
Increasing our recycled content usage has driven a 12% average reduction in greenhouse gas (GHG) impact per bottle.
We are currently working with a broad set of partners and government to increase the amount of recycled content available so that we can use even more!
A PET bottle provides the smallest ratio of packaging material to product, while providing superior protection and safety. All of our bottles and caps are recyclable** with no BPA added.

Solar panels at our Rialto, CA facility
The solar panel systems at our Rialto, CA and San Antonio, TX plants are now operational. They now provide up to 20% of the energy required and will further lower our CO2 emissions. Our Bloomfield, CT plant will also have solar power towards the end of 2022.
Four of our Texas plants have been running on 100% renewable energy since July 2021! The power comes from a local wind farm. It will continue to provide 100% clean energy for the next 10 years.
Niagara leads the beverage industry in energy efficiency by:
Utilizing industry leading bottling equipment, laser-guided vehicles and automatic storage and retrieval systems to reduce emissions which create a healthy and safe environment for our Team Members
Using alternative energy sources like wind power and expanding are usage of solar into our operations
Incorporating skylights and automated lighting to decrease the energy used to power and light all of our plants
Reducing the energy needed to transform plastic into formed bottles
Technologies in lighting (LED) to reduce heat loads and electricity use while creating a safer and more productive work environment
Managing our carbon footprint through the use of recycled plastic (rPET)
Our 0.5L bottles have an embodied carbon footprint that is 46% below the U.S. average resulting in savings of 1.7 pounds of CO
2
per pound of rPET produced.

Providing Access to Clean Water
Our mission of delivering high-quality water does not stop at the shelf. We demonstrate our commitment to providing access to clean drinking water through in-kind donations, volunteer service and being there when needed most.
Natural disasters devastate communities and the environment, leaving public water systems compromised in the aftermath and unsafe by both state and federal health standards. In partnership with organizations such as Feed the Children American Red Cross and Incident Action Planning, Niagara has responded to disasters such as Hurricane Harvey, Flint Water Crisis, Hurricane Sandy, and the tsunami in Japan by providing safe, clean water to those affected by catastrophic events.
We donated over 4 million bottles of water across the various areas impacted by Hurricane Harvey and Hurricane Irma. We also partnered with Feed the Children to provide nearly 3 million bottles of water to those affected in the Flint, MI water crisis and more than 1.2 million bottles of water to communities impacted by the catastrophic floods in Louisiana.
Also, more than 40 of our Team Members traveled to El Jiote, Honduras in partnership with Global Water Brigades to support the build of a new, clean water system benefiting more than 560 residents.

What types of bottled water does Niagara® make?
Purified Drinking Water: Sourced from either deep protected wells or from municipal water supplies. This water is purified through microfiltration and reverse osmosis which removes the salts, minerals, and any suspended solids from the water. Niagara
®
also incorporates ozone contact systems to disinfect their drinking water and ensure the highest quality product.
Purified Drinking Water with Minerals Added: Processed in the same manner as purified water then has a defined mix of minerals added back.
Alkaline: Products are made using a similar process as purified drinking water with minerals added; however, there is an additional electrolysis step to increase the pH.
Spring Water: Water is obtained from protected spring sources approved by our quality team before being brought to our bottling facilities. We then use microfiltration and ozone to disinfect the water while making sure that no minerals are removed.
Distilled Water: Water purified by reverse osmosis, then distilled to remove virtually all traces of mineral content. The water is then disinfected with ozone.
What is the shelf-life or Best By Date of my Niagara® bottled water?
The typical shelf life for each product is as follows:
Purified Water, Purified Water with Minerals, Spring Water and Distilled Water: 547 days.
Alkaline: 730 days.
Niagara
®
Sparkling: 270 days.
To find the specific “Best If Used By” date on your product, please refer to the date etched into the bottle, just above the label.
What minerals are in my Niagara® bottled water?
Purified and alkaline water have very small amounts of food-grade minerals that are added strictly for taste and have no nutritional value.
Spring water mineral content is specific to the spring source and varies depending on the location of the spring.
Distilled water removes all traces of mineral content through the distillation process.
Check the label on your Niagara
®
bottled water bottle for specific minerals that were added. You can also check out our
Water Quality Report
for more information regarding mineral content.
What water source is used to make Niagara® purified bottled water?
Each bottle of water begins with a carefully selected well, spring or municipal water source. The water is initially processed using a multi-step filtration process. Next, the water is purified using a reverse osmosis or distillation system and then it is disinfected with ozone just prior to bottling.
What water source is used to make Niagara® spring bottled water?
Providing great tasting spring water starts with finding the best tasting, highest quality source. All spring sources undergo an intense audit and review before being selected. The sources are inspected by our trained and experienced Quality Assurance staff, which includes microbiologists, chemists, and hydrogeologists. During the inspection process, all aspects of the source are examined including security, treatment at the source, water chemistry, and environmental impact. Once a spring is approved for use, the spring water is collected and then loaded onto dedicated water tankers and delivered to our bottling facilities. Water is tested at our facility to ensure quality and safety prior to use. It is then filtered down to 0.2 microns and disinfected with ozone just prior to bottling.
What is reverse osmosis?
Reverse osmosis is a process that removes nearly all of the salts or minerals in the source water. Reverse osmosis works by forcing water through a semipermeable membrane at high pressure and is a very effective method for purification.
What is micron filtration?
Micron filtration removes sediment and suspended particles. These filters are designed to remove particles as small as 0.2 micron in diameter.
How is the water processed to make Niagara® bottled water?
Please view
this video
to learn more about our multi-step quality process.
Is there sodium in Niagara® bottled water?
For purified and distilled products, any sodium in the source water is removed in the purification process.
For purified drinking water with minerals, the sodium content is approximately 1mg per 16.9 oz.  Please view our
Water Quality Report
for more information.
Is there fluoride in Niagara® bottled water?
Fluoride is often added to municipal water supplies, but it is generally not added to bottled water products. Spring water may contain natural fluoride levels. Fluoride in the source water is removed in the purification process for all of our purified and distilled bottled water. To learn more about our water, please view our
Water Quality Report
.
What is the pH of my Niagara® bottled water?
Spring water, purified drinking water and purified drinking water with minerals have a pH of less than 8.0. Alkaline water has a pH of greater than 9.0 at the time of bottling.
Our bottled water samples are tested daily in each facility’s quality laboratory using calibrated pH meters. To properly test the water, we use a calibrated pH meter with an attached high purity pH probe at the time of bottling. A calibrated pH meter is an electronic instrument used to measure the pH (acidity or alkalinity) of a liquid. This specialized equipment is the only way to obtain an accurate pH result from high purity waters and help to ensure that the water produced meets the strict quality specifications defined for these bottled water products.
Our bottled water products typically have a total dissolved solids less than 60ppm, keeping it well below the ability of a pH strip to provide an accurate reading. Litmus papers or test strips will NOT test accurately on high purity bottled water products.
Do Niagara® water bottles contain BPA?
We do not use or add BPA to any of the materials used in any of our bottled water containers. BPA (Bisphenol –A) is a chemical building block used primarily to make polycarbonate plastic and epoxy resins.
All of our bottles are produced using PET (polyethylene terephthalate) plastic and high-density polyethylene (HDPE) caps. These are food grade plastics that are approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration for their use in many types of food containers.
What is the quality of my bottled water?
To learn more about our water, please view our
Water Quality Report
available in both English and Spanish.
Is the water used in Niagara® bottled water tested?
Our on-site testing laboratories are equipped with state-of-the-art testing machinery and staffed with degreed, experienced personnel. Comparative analyses are performed daily on products in accordance with state and federal regulatory standards. We test for organic chemicals and inorganic chemicals as regulated by the FDA and some individual states.
Is it safe to refill Niagara® water bottles or freeze them?
Our bottles are filled under sanitary conditions and are disinfected during the production process. Freezing the bottle is harmless to the product. However, as water freezes, it expands and will distort the shape of the bottle causing instability. It may potentially expand through the cap and break the seal.
How should I store my bottled water?
The International Bottled Water Association (IBWA)
advises consumers to store bottled water at room temperature or cooler, out of direct sunlight, and away from solvents and chemicals such as gasoline, paint thinners, household cleaners and dry cleaning chemicals.
Is my Niagara® bottled water recyclable?
Our bottles and caps are 100% recyclable
*
.  Please empty and replace cap prior to recycling. To learn more about where you can recycle your bottle, visit
How2Recycle.info
.
*
Excludes label and outer packaging, which may not be recyclable in your area.
Why is my Niagara® bottled water flimsy and my cap smaller than other brands?
In the past 15 years, we have reduced the amount of plastic in our Eco-Air
®
Bottle by over 60% versus our original 1998 500mL bottle. Because of the reduced weight in our plastic, we can:
Transport more water per truckload which reduces CO
2
emissions
Use less plastic per bottle which helps conserve valuable resources
Since 2009, Niagara® has reduced the carbon footprint of its bottles by 59% through innovations in design, lightweighting, and packaging.
In addition, we’ve reduced our label size and bottle cap size to further reduce our material use.

I want to sell Niagara® water at my store. What should I do?
For all sales inquiries, please email
sales@niagarawater.com
.
Should I be concerned about microplastics?
According to the FDA, there is not sufficient scientific evidence to show that microplastics and nanoplastics from plastic food packaging migrate into foods and beverages. Current scientific evidence does not demonstrate that levels of microplastics or nanoplastics found in foods pose a risk to human health. Many of the scientific studies have used methods of variable, questionable, and/or limited accuracy and specificity. Please reference this link to learn more about how the
FDA keeps bottled water safe to drink

Our Focus on Sustainability
Niagara is committed to responsible resource usage and integrating sustainability into every aspect of our business. Niagara not only supports environmental initiatives, but also innovation and leadership in our product, packaging, and manufacturing while promoting consumer awareness and action on sustainability issues. Here’s how Niagara is prioritizing sustainability:
Water Stewardship:
A standard Niagara facility uses less water to produce its products than it takes to keep a few golf courses green. Niagara typically pays volumetric fees for the water used and millions in taxes and fees to municipal systems that enable us to maintain and improve our infrastructure.
Packaging Efficiency
: Part of Niagara’s success is from using less plastic for our bottles than our competitors.
Minimizing Environmental Impact:
Niagara PET bottles have a lower environmental impact across most impact categories when compared to other common beverage and water packaging types. Our half-liter bottles have an embodied carbon footprint that is substantially below the U.S. average.
Recycling Infrastructure and Education
: Niagara supports recycling education through International Bottled Water Association’s “Put it in the Bin” campaign.

Niagara Bottling has an extensive and important presence in Stockton, manufacturing a variety of consumer beverages.

Niagara’s overall employment in Stockton currently stands at approximately 415 full-time positions between the four plants, and it is projected to grow to an estimated 457 employees once all facilities are completed. All-in compensation (regular pay, overtime, bonuses, holidays, tuition, benefits, etc.) for all of 2023 is approximately $30 million, and projected combined payroll for all four facilities will be just over $40 million. Collectively, they are expected to generate over $1 million dollars in annual tax revenues for the city of Stockton.

Getting Students Ready for School
Our Stockton teams stuffed 350 backpacks with school supplies to support youth in our local communities. Through our partnership with Volunteers of America, and their Northern California/Northern Nevada (NCNN) affiliate, Niagara supported their Operation Backpack program with a $10,000 grant donation. From backpacks and notepads to pencils and erasers, students in elementary, middle, and high school will soon receive the educational tools they need to succeed.
UNeed2 and Women’s Center Youth & Family Services were some of the local recipients of the program, assisting more than 300 students in Stockton. Overall, the local Operation Backpack program provides over 5,000 backpacks and supplies for students across the Sacramento region.
Having a brand-new backpack and supplies not only provides a child in difficult circumstances with the tools they need to succeed, it also gives them confidence and hope.
Spreading Holiday Cheer
Our teams in Stockton worked with Volunteers of America to make “Waiting for Santa Kits” for children at their family shelter. The kits included pajamas, hot cocoa, cookies to put out for Santa, a book to read while they wait for him to come, and letters from Santa written by our Team Members. These gifts and letters from Santa provided a memorable holiday experience for the benefiting families during a difficult time in their lives.
Shoe Drive
Our team supported a shoe drive in Elk Grove by donating two pallets of water for their event as well as setting up chairs, tables, banners and activity stations.
Some of the local organizations our Team Members regularly donate their time and resources to include:
Boss Lift guard/reserve deployment support

In the event of timely cure by Niagara, Niagara shall not be deemed in breach and shall not be charged any late charges, late fees, penalties, or interest. In no event shall Carrier have a lien on any of Niagara’s Loads, products or finished goods to secure payment of any invoices or charges.

Should Niagara subsequently offer tenders for Loads not included in the Award or agreement and Carrier agrees to transport such Loads, Carrier agrees to transport such Load at the same rates as the delivery of Loads in the Award unless otherwise agreed to in writing by the Parties. Carrier must notify Niagara within ninety (90) minutes of receipt of Niagara’s tender offer that Carrier has: (a) received the tender offer; and (b) confirm that it will transport the Load.

Carrier shall maintain a 98% monthly rate for on-time delivery of Loads through the entire term of the Award. On-time delivery of Loads shall mean Loads delivered within thirty (30) minutes of a scheduled delivery appointment time.

Niagara may scale and weigh all Loads and shall provide a pallet count for all Loads. In accepting any Load, Carrier agrees to count all pallet quantities prior to sealing the trailer. Niagara will make its best effort to produce a tactical forecast of the projected volume of Loads and weights for the upcoming month. In the event Niagara requests Carrier to haul 20% more of its projected daily volume, Carrier shall comply with such a request. In the event Carrier is unable to haul Niagara’s scale and weighted Load, causing Niagara to remove any products or pallets, Carrier agrees that Niagara may deduct a fee of $100 per occurrence from Carrier’s corresponding purchase order. d) Equipment. Carrier shall ensure that all equipment used in connection with performing Transporting Services be clean, odor-free, dry, leak-proof, and free of contamination and/or infestation. Carrier warrants that no motor vehicle, trailer, tractor or other equipment that will be used for Transportation Services for Niagara has been used to transport refuse, garbage, trash or solid or liquid waste of any kind, or any types of hazardous materials.

Carrier, at its sole expense, must maintain and make available a telephone line for customer service to Niagara. Such customer service line will be operational twenty-four hours a day, seven days a week, and shall respond within thirty (30) minutes of contact by Niagara.
Documentation. With respect to the following documents, Carrier agrees to maintain the documents as follows: a) Daily reports: Carrier shall provide Niagara daily reports regarding the status of all Loads and delivery times; b) Proof of Delivery (POD): Carrier shall provide Niagara free of charge with any and all PODs within 48-hours of delivery of any Load, and shall maintain all such PODs for at least twelve (12) months from the date of delivery, or for a period as proscribed by law; c) Bill of Lading (BOL): Carrier agrees that Niagara’s bill of lading shall be considered: (i) an acceptable form of receipt hereunder, and (ii) specific shipping instructions.

Carrier Failure to provide Proof of Delivery (POD). In the event Carrier fails to provide a POD within 48 hours of delivery, Niagara shall have the right to deduct all amounts paid for Transportation Services, or demand payment for the amount of the Transportation Service invoice. Additionally, if Carrier cannot provide the POD within fourteen (14) days of delivery, Niagara may charge Carrier for the cost of any of Niagara’s customer’s invoice for product not paid. Alternatively, if Niagara receives a refusal to pay for a Load from its customer, Niagara will provide Carrier of evidence of customer refusal and proof of loss, and shall charge Carrier the cost of customer’s invoice for product.
Assignment and Subcontracting. Carrier agrees not to interline, use other motor carriers or brokers, or to use “substituted services” or otherwise assign or subcontract any portion of any Award, agreement or purchase order without the express written consent of Niagara. If, with the express written permission of Niagara, Carrier elects to use a delivery agent or subcontract the transportation of a Load, Carrier shall be the sole bearer of any costs associated with the delivery agent or subcontractor and agrees to be fully liable for any loss, damage, or delay to transportation of any such Loads while in this third party carrier’s care, custody and/or control. Carrier understands and agrees that all payments made by Niagara are conditioned upon Niagara’s receipt of a conditional waiver and release executed by Carrier and an unconditional waiver and release executed by each Additional Party. Carrier agrees to defend, indemnify and hold Niagara and its customer’s harmless from any and all claims of any Additional Party for payment.

Niagara’s delay, failure or partial exercise of any provision herein or waiver of any breach, right or remedy contained in or granted by any Award, agreement or purchase order shall not be deemed a waiver of any breach, right or remedy unless expressly stated as such by Niagara in writing signed by an authorized representative of Niagara, and then such waiver shall be limited solely to its specific terms.
Limitation of Liability. In no event shall Niagara be liable for any punitive, exemplary, special, incidental, indirect or consequential damages of any kind (including, but not limited to loss of profits, loss of reputation, and/or loss of current or prospective business advantage, when where such losses are characterized as direct damages) arising out of or in any way related to the relationship and/or dealings between Niagara and Carrier regardless of whether the claim under which damages are sought is based upon contract, tort, negligence, strict liability or otherwise, and regardless of whether the parties have been advised of the possibility of such damages at the time of contracting or otherwise. Under no circumstances shall Niagara’s maximum total liability, if any, arising out of or in any way related to the relationship and/or dealings between Niagara and Carrier exceed the amounts paid and/or due to Carrier by Niagara under any relationship between the Parties, Award, agreement or purchase order.
Liability for Loss, Damage or Delay to Loads. a) Carrier agrees that in the transportation of all Loads hereunder, it shall assume, and does assume, the liability of an interstate motor carrier, as provided by 49 U.S.C. § 14706, with such liability to exist from the time of the receipt of any of said goods by Carrier until proper delivery has been made to the location specified by Niagara. The Parties expressly decline to limit the value of the property as permitted by 49 U.S.C. § 14706(c). All claims will be filed and resolved in accordance with the ICC regulations in 49 CFR Part 370. b) All Loads tendered to Carrier for transportation will be palletized and stretch wrapped. Carrier reserves the right to refuse to accept any Load that is not so packaged. c) Parties agree that each incident of transportation of product under any Award, agreement or purchase order shall be evidenced by a BOL signed by Carrier and Niagara showing the kind, quantity, value and condition of products or goods received and delivered by Carrier at the loading and unloading points respectively. Carrier’s duties and responsibilities under any Award, agreement or purchase order between the Parties for the transport of any Load evidenced by such receipt shall commence when Carrier takes possession and control of Niagara’s property or upon execution of such receipt by Niagara, whichever occurs first, and shall end when consignee/customer/buyer signs a delivery receipt and Carrier delivers Niagara’s property. Carrier shall inspect all Loads prior to accepting possession and control and shall document any evidence of damage on the BOL. If Carrier does not indicate damage on the BOL at the time of possession and immediately communicates the existence of such damage to Niagara, Carrier agrees that damage documented upon delivery presumptively occurred while the Load was in Carrier’s custody and possession. d) The time limit within which Niagara must file a claim for damaged or lost products or goods against Carrier shall be nine (9) months from the date of delivery or within nine (9) months of the reasonably anticipated date of delivery in the event of a complete loss. All claims shall be paid, settled or disallowed by Carrier within ninety (90) days of filing. Disallowance shall state a lawful reason for declining to accept responsibility for the claim, and shall be stated by Carrier, not its insurer. In no event shall Niagara be required to work with Carrier’s insurer directly. Niagara agrees to immediately provide written notice of claim to Carrier showing kind, quantity, value and proof of carriage as evidenced by a signed BOL. e) In the event of Carrier’s breach, or alleged breach, as determined solely by Niagara, of any provision in any Award, agreement or purchase order between the Parties, in addition to all other remedies in law or equity that are available to Niagara, Carrier shall be responsible for all reasonable attorneys’ fees and costs incurred by Niagara as a result of said breach or alleged breach.
Product Loss or Damage. a) Rejected Load. In the event the Niagara’s customer rejects the delivery of any Load due to the fault of Carrier, Carrier must return the Load to the pick-up origin designated by Niagara at no cost. In the event Niagara’s customer rejects the delivery of a Load due to no fault of the Carrier, Niagara shall pay a transportation rate equal to the rate Niagara paid Carrier to transport the Load to Niagara’s customer. Any and all rejected Loads not scheduled for redelivery must be delivered back to Niagara’s pick-up origin within five (5) days from the time/date of initial pick-up. Any Load being transported back to Niagara’s pick-up origin must be secured with either a seal or padlock and a confirmation must be sent via email to executionteam@niagarawater.com. Return charges for shorthaul clusters will be returned at half the published rate of the Load. For long haul cluster freight, return charges will not exceed the total all-in rate of the Load. b) Visual Damage to Products. 1) For damages to individual cases of product up to less than one pallet, Niagara’s customer must note the damage on the BOL, and customer or Carrier may dispose of or donate damaged cases of product. 2) For damage to one or more pallets, Niagara’s customer must note the damage on the BOL. If the Load is rejected and remains in the custody of Carrier, Carrier must immediately contact Niagara Dispatch for deposition instructions. Carrier must provide the purchase order number, date and time of single delivery, number of pallets damaged and/or refused, bottle code, any photographs, a brief description of the damage, and contact information, including contact name, phone number, email and facsimile number. c) Concealed Damage to Products. If Niagara’s customer reports concealed damage to the product, pallet and/or Load, such damage will be investigated to determine liability. If the investigation concludes that Carrier is responsible for the damage, Carrier will be notified of Niagara’s intent to file a claim and will be given the opportunity to inspect the product, pallet, or Load prior to disposition for disposal or donation. d) Product Loss/Delay. In the event Carrier is unable to execute delivery for reasons such as theft of Load, vehicular accident, or delay impacting the product’s integrity (i.e., non-delivery of Load/products to its specified destination within five (5) calendar days), recovery of loss will be executed pursuant to 49 CFR 370. e) Donation/Disposal. Due to product liability, trademark protection, and/or licensing agreements for private label stock, any distressed, damaged or otherwise rejected shipment that is not returned to a Niagara facility, for whatever reason, must be properly disposed of or donated in accordance with Niagara’s express written instruction. IN NO CIRCUMSTANCE CAN ANY GOODS, PRODUCTS OR INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY EVER BE RE-SOLD. Carrier understands and agrees that in no event shall Carrier nor any Carrier Actors, without the prior express written consent of Niagara: (i) cause, suffer or permit the transfer, salvage, disposal and/or donation of any Goods, Products or Intellectual Property, and/or (ii) offer to transfer, salvage, dispose of and/or donate any Goods, Products or Intellectual Property, whether as salvage or otherwise. Notwithstanding the foregoing, if there is a distressed, damaged or otherwise rejected Load of product that is not returned to a Niagara facility, and Niagara gives express written permission to a Carrier to dispose of or donate the goods or products, Niagara shall require written verification, signed by the Carrier’s authorized agent, which provides exact details as to the final disposition as well as copies of donation/disposal receipts as backup. f) Claim Settlement. In order to close a freight claim as settled, one of the following conclusions must be obtained: • Granted: paid in full • Declined: written declination including a specific legal reason • Compromised: written offer to settle for less than the original claim amount, including legal rationale for offer to pay less than full amount claimed g) Payment. Any and all payments from Carrier to Niagara in settlement of a claim must be made, in full, and sent to: Niagara Bottling, LLC 2560 E. Philadelphia Street Ontario, CA 91761 Attention: Claims Specialist Niagara’s claim reference number must appear on the check. A partial payment check will not be accepted and will not be cashed as a granted or settled claim.
Seals. Carrier agrees to comply with the Food and Drug Administration and industry standards with regard to seals as codified in FDA 21 CFR 110.93, which states that all transportation of food shall be under conditions to protect that food. Storage and transportation of finished food shall be under conditions that will protect the food against physical, chemical, and microbial contamination as well as against deterioration of the food and the container, Carrier further agrees to use standard industry practices, including, but not limited to ensuring that any and all trailers from or on behalf of Niagara will be kept sealed while transporting all goods. Carrier must confirm that the seal has been secured on the trailer and that the seal number is recorded on the BOL by Niagara prior to leaving any of Niagara’s facilities. If the seal is required to be broken at any time during transport, Carrier must first seek Niagara’s authorization. Carrier must then notify Niagara that the trailer has been re-sealed by sending an e-mail to executionteam@niagarawater.com. In the event Niagara’s customer breaks the seal, rejects the Load, and does not provide Carrier with a new seal to re-seal the trailer, Niagara’s customer or Carrier must add a lock to the trailer to secure the Load. It is Carrier’s sole responsibility to ensure that the trailer is re-sealed or a lock is added to the trailer prior to leaving Niagara’s customer’s facilities. No Loads will be accepted by Niagara without a seal or lock on the trailer.
Insurance. During the term of all Awards, agreements or purchase orders, and after any termination of or expiration, and for as long as Carrier owes any obligation to Niagara and/or any statute of limitations for any potential claim that Niagara may have against Carrier remains unexpired, Carrier and any Carrier Actors shall maintain all insurance and/or bonds required by statute, law and any Award, agreement or purchase order with minimum insurance limits consistent with Niagara’s insurance requirements set forth at the end of this Section 16. Should insurance policy limits be exhausted or should Carrier or any Carrier Actors fail to maintain the required insurance coverage, neither Carrier nor any Carrier Actor will in any way be relieved from liability provided for herein to Niagara should a loss occur. Carrier shall furnish Niagara with a certificate evidencing the aforementioned coverage limits via email to insurancecerts@niagarawater.com. Such certificate shall provide for thirty (30) days written notice to Niagara in the event of cancellation. All certificates of insurance shall name Niagara Bottling, LLC and its parents, subsidiaries, employees, agents, affiliates and assigns as an additional insured by policy endorsement (on both Carrier’s General Liability Policy, Automobile Liability Policy and Cargo Insurance Policy) and waive all rights of subrogation against Niagara, its parent, director, officers, employees, stockholders, subsidiaries and affiliates with regard to Employee Liability and Workers Compensation. For any claims relating to an Agreement, agreement or purchase order, the Carrier’s insurance shall be deemed to be primary and not contributing to or in excess of any similar coverage purchased by Niagara. Carrier hereby acknowledges that naming Niagara Bottling, LLC and its parents, subsidiaries, employees, agents, affiliates and assigns as an additional insured by policy endorsement is a condition precedent to payment by Niagara. For the avoidance of doubt, Niagara will not be required to submit payment until the requirements of this provision have been met. However, failure of Niagara to demand any certificates or to identify any deficiency in the insurance provided shall not be construed as or deemed to be a waiver of the Carrier’s (or its agents or subcontractors) obligation to maintain such insurance. If any of the coverages are required to remain in force after termination of the Agreement, Carrier shall submit additional certificates evidencing continuation of coverage until such obligation ends. Niagara’s Minimum Insurance Requirements: Commercial General Liability $2,000,000 per occurrence; $5,000,000 aggregate Auto Liability $3,000,000 combined single limit Cargo $100,000 Employee Liability/Workman’s Comp $2,000,000/Statutory In addition to the general insurance requirements provided in the above table, customized insurance requirements for specific Seller-types are attached hereto and incorporated herein by this reference.
Termination. a) Any Award, agreement or purchase order shall commence on the date such Award is given, agreement is entered into or purchase order is issued, and shall automatically renew on a year-to-year basis until terminated, provided that Carrier is performing in accordance with these Carrier Standard T&C’s, the Award, agreement or purchase order, and that Carrier continues to provide Niagara the lowest available rates in the market and the lowest rates and/or most favorable terms at which Carrier offers its service to any third party shipper in the same functional level of the trade as Niagara (“Most Favorable Rates”). The Parties agree to meet in good faith to discuss existing rates at a time no earlier than twelve (12) months after the Award is issued or an agreement is entered into by the Parties. Such discussions may result in a rate adjustment if, and only if, the adjustment is in reference to driver pay, and only upon mutual written consent by both Parties. Notwithstanding the foregoing, Carrier guarantees that any rate increase will not exceed 2% of the current rate. In the event that Carrier does not provide Niagara with the Most Favorable Rates, Niagara shall have the right to terminate by giving thirty (30) days written notice to Carrier. b) If during the term specified by any Award, agreement, or purchase order either party (i) files a petition in bankruptcy or has a petition in bankruptcy filed against it that is not dismissed within sixty (60) days, or (ii) makes a general assignment for the benefit of creditors, then in any such case the non-bankrupt party may terminate any Award, agreement or purchase order by giving written notice of such effect to the bankrupt party. c) If all or any portion of Carrier’s registration, as required by any Award, agreement or purchase order, is revoked, canceled, suspended, or discontinued by operation of law or otherwise (“Registration Issue”), or if Carrier’s insurance policies are canceled, reduced or otherwise invalidated (“Insurance Issue”), Carrier shall promptly notify Niagara, and in no case later than forty-eight (48) hours after Carrier learns of any such Registration or Insurance Issue and Niagara shall have the right to terminate any Award, agreement or purchase order immediately and/ or collect reimbursement for all expenses it has incurred in preparation of and/ or as a result of any Award, agreement or purchase order from Carrier. Carrier’s notification to Niagara in regards to the above shall in no way serve as a waiver by Niagara of its right to construe such as a breach of any Award, agreement or purchase order and shall in no way limit Niagara’s right to pursue all remedies in law or equity as a result of such breach. d) If, in Niagara’s sole discretion, delays in transportation cause inconvenience and/or harm to Niagara’s business interests, or Carrier is otherwise in breach of any Award, agreement or purchase order, Niagara shall provide written notice to Carrier outlining the delay and resulting or anticipated harm and/or breach. If the deficiencies and/or breach remain following a period of thirty (30) days from the date written notice was provided, as is measured as of the date specified on the notice, Niagara may terminate any Award, agreement or purchase order upon thirty (30) days written notice to Carrier. e) In the event of any discontinuation and/or revision to any regulations and/or laws in the United States (or any other country where Carrier services Niagara), and/or if Niagara, in its sole discretion, determines that the services contemplated in any Award, agreement or purchase order are no longer necessary or required and/or that Niagara’s course of business strategy has changed, Niagara may terminate any Award, agreement or purchase order in part or in its entirety upon sixty (60) days’ notice to Carrier. f) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary herein, Niagara shall have the ability to terminate any Award, agreement or purchase order for convenience with a sixty (60) day written notice, and Carrier shall have the ability to terminate any Award or agreement with one hundred eighty (180) day written notice to Niagara.

During the term as set forth by Niagara in its sole discretion, as described in any Award or agreement, Carrier agrees only to charge the rates set forth by Niagara (“Base Rate”) for the Transportation Services in Lanes and/or Loads as requested by Niagara as full and complete compensation for the Transportation Services being provided by Carrier. Should Niagara provide an Award to Carrier for additional Lanes and/or Loads to provide Transportation Services to, such additional Award will be subject to these Standard Carrier T&C’s.
Payment Terms. Prior to commencement of Transportation Services, and in order to receive payment from Niagara, Carrier must provide Niagara with a Certificate of Insurance (COI) in accordance with Section 16 herein. Carrier shall only invoice Niagara for awarded Lanes and/or Loads received from Niagara. Such invoice and all supporting documents shall be submitted promptly, following transport of any Load to Niagara via email at truckingbackup@niagarawater.com. Such invoices must include Carrier’s name and invoice number in the subject line. Each email shall only include one (1) invoice per email submission.

Any and all payments by Niagara shall be deemed effective as of the date of postmark. Niagara shall have no liability for invoices that are not received within ninety (90) days of transport of any Load. Niagara shall have no liability for added, balance due, accessorial or any other charges of any nature which are not provided by the Award and which are not submitted within ninety (90) days from date of transport of a Load. Carrier agrees to apply payment to the amount due for the specified invoice regardless of whether there are earlier unpaid invoices. In the event any payment becomes overdue, Carrier shall provide written notice to nonpayment via certified mail to: Attn: Vice President of Legal Affairs, Niagara Bottling, LLC, 2560 E. Philadelphia Street, Ontario, California 91761. Carrier shall also notify Niagara by sending emails to the following: Debra Morrison at dmorrison@niagarawater.com and transprocurement@niagarawater.com.

Carrier is solely responsible for scheduling and complying with any and all deliveries and delivery times as requested by Niagara’s customers. a) Pick-up of Loads. Carrier shall maintain a monthly on-time pick up appoint rate of a minimum of 90% from the designated Niagara facility through the entire term of the Award. If Carrier’s monthly pick-up rate falls below 90%, Carrier agrees to a $50 fee for every late pick-up appointment for the previous month that caused Carrier to fall below the 90% pick-up rate. b) Delivery of Loads. Carrier shall maintain a 98% monthly rate for on-time delivery of Loads through the entire term of the Award. On-time delivery of Loads shall mean Loads delivered within thirty (30) minutes of a scheduled delivery appointment time. If Carrier’s monthly on-time delivery rate to Niagara or its customer’s locations falls below 98%, Carrier agrees to a $100 fee for every late and/or missed delivery appointment for the previous month that caused Carrier to fall below the 98% delivery rate. c) Payload: Carrier warrants that it has the ability to ship Loads that are 45,600 pounds or less. Niagara may scale and weigh all Loads and shall provide a pallet count for all Loads. In accepting any Load, Carrier agrees to count all pallet quantities prior to sealing the trailer.

Such customer service line will be operational twenty-four hours a day, seven days a week, and shall respond within thirty (30) minutes of contact by Niagara.
Documentation. With respect to the following documents, Carrier agrees to maintain the documents as follows: a) Daily reports: Carrier shall provide Niagara daily reports regarding the status of all Loads and delivery times; b) Proof of Delivery (POD): Carrier shall provide Niagara free of charge with any and all PODs within 48-hours of delivery of any Load, and shall maintain all such PODs for at least twelve (12) months from the date of delivery, or for a period as proscribed by law; c) Bill of Lading (BOL): Carrier agrees that Niagara’s bill of lading shall be considered: (i) an acceptable form of receipt hereunder, and (ii) specific shipping instructions. These Standard Carrier T&C’s shall be incorporated by reference into each and every such BOL and in the event of an inconsistency, these Standard Carrier T&C’s shall control; and d) Supporting documents for Accessorial charges: Carrier agrees to provide all documents in accordance with Section 18 of these Standard Terms and Conditions.

In the event Carrier fails to provide a POD within 48 hours of delivery, Niagara shall have the right to deduct all amounts paid for Transportation Services, or demand payment for the amount of the Transportation Service invoice. Additionally, if Carrier cannot provide the POD within fourteen (14) days of delivery, Niagara may charge Carrier for the cost of any of Niagara’s customer’s invoice for product not paid. Alternatively, if Niagara receives a refusal to pay for a Load from its customer, Niagara will provide Carrier of evidence of customer refusal and proof of loss, and shall charge Carrier the cost of customer’s invoice for product.
Assignment and Subcontracting. Carrier agrees not to interline, use other motor carriers or brokers, or to use “substituted services” or otherwise assign or subcontract any portion of any Award, agreement or purchase order without the express written consent of Niagara. If, with the express written permission of Niagara, Carrier elects to use a delivery agent or subcontract the transportation of a Load, Carrier shall be the sole bearer of any costs associated with the delivery agent or subcontractor and agrees to be fully liable for any loss, damage, or delay to transportation of any such Loads while in this third party carrier’s care, custody and/or control. Carrier understands and agrees that all payments made by Niagara are conditioned upon Niagara’s receipt of a conditional waiver and release executed by Carrier and an unconditional waiver and release executed by each Additional Party. Carrier agrees to defend, indemnify and hold Niagara and its customer’s harmless from any and all claims of any Additional Party for payment. Carrier acknowledges and agrees that Carrier shall remain, at all times, fully liable for all Additional Parties. Carrier warrants that it shall ensure that Additional Parties comply with and adhere to all warranties, representations, obligations, terms and conditions contained herein.
Compliance with Law. At all times during the Award or agreement term or its relationship with Niagara, Carrier shall comply with all applicable state and federal laws. Additionally, Carrier shall operate all Carrier Equipment in compliance with industry standard, and shall maintain and operate the same such that Carrier’s safety rating does not fall below “satisfactory” under the Federal Motor Carrier Safety Administration standards. In the event that Carrier’s safety rating falls below a “satisfactory”, Carrier shall notify Niagara immediately, and Niagara will have the immediate right to terminate any Award, agreement or purchase order upon notice to Carrier.
Indemnification: a) Carrier agrees to indemnify, defend, and hold Niagara, its affiliates, and representatives harmless from and against any and all claims arising out of or related to any Award, agreement, or purchase order and/or Transportation Services that are the subject thereof, including but not limited to: (i) any bodily injury or property damage claims, and any liability, loss, cost, expense, or other damages (including reasonable attorney fees) brought about by any injury of any kind suffered by any person or property as a result of any act, neglect, default, omission of either the Carrier, Carrier’s agents, employees, affiliates, subcontractors, or any third party for whose actions Carrier is responsible (“Carrier Actors”), or Niagara, Niagara’s agents, employees, affiliates, subcontractors or other representatives; (ii) any negligent act, misfeasance, or nonfeasance by Carrier, or Carrier Actors; (iii) any harm, injury, damage, or loss arising out of or in connection with the Transportation Services provided; (iv) third party consumer claims, suits, and/or demands, including costs and expenses of investigation and settlement and attorneys’ fees and expenses, to the extent such claims arise from: (a) any act or omission by Carrier or Carrier Actors relating to or affecting the condition, quality, or character of any Goods or Services provided; or (b) trademark, copyright, trade dress, or patent infringement. Carrier acknowledges and agrees that Carrier must receive Niagara’s express written approval prior to settling any claim or lawsuit. Niagara reserves the right at any time to control its own defense. b) Should Carrier receive (or become aware of) any demand, service of process, notice, action, settlement, summons, complaint or the like from or by a third party alleging that a Party hereto is responsible for some injury, act, omission, breach, negligence, claim, loss, violation of law, settlement, cost, expense, obligation, liability, damage, recovery, deficiency or otherwise, including, without limitation, interest, penalties, reasonable attorney fees and costs (each, a “Claim”) that arises out of, results from, or in any way relates to the subject matter of these Standard Terms and Conditions, an Award, agreement or purchase order, then Carrier shall immediately (but no later than five (5) business days after receipt, or becoming aware, of a third party Claim) provide Niagara with written notice regarding each third party Claim of which Carrier is or becomes aware. Carrier covenants and agrees that should Carrier fail to provide Niagara with timely written notice regarding any third party Claim, Carrier hereby generally and expressly waives, relinquishes and releases, and agrees to hold harmless, Niagara from and against any and all Claims capable of being asserted by Carrier against Niagara in connection therewith. c) In the event Carrier utilizes any party (“Additional Party”) regardless of that party’s legal designation of contractor, subcontractor, materials supplier, agent, or otherwise, for the purpose of performing any Transportation Services, Carrier shall submit to Niagara written notice of (i) each Additional Party, (ii) the duties each Additional Party will undertake, (iii) the amount of compensation each Additional Party is to receive from Carrier, and (iv) Carrier’s compensation schedule and payment terms with the Additional Party. Carrier understands submitting this written notice as set forth above is a condition precedent to payment. Such written notice must be sent to Vice President of Legal Affairs via email and certified mail (1) panderson@niagarawater.com, (2) 2560 E. Philadelphia St., Ontario, CA 91761. g) Waiver. Niagara’s delay, failure or partial exercise of any provision herein or waiver of any breach, right or remedy contained in or granted by any Award, agreement or purchase order shall not be deemed a waiver of any breach, right or remedy unless expressly stated as such by Niagara in writing signed by an authorized representative of Niagara, and then such waiver shall be limited solely to its specific terms.
Limitation of Liability. In no event shall Niagara be liable for any punitive, exemplary, special, incidental, indirect or consequential damages of any kind (including, but not limited to loss of profits, loss of reputation, and/or loss of current or prospective business advantage, when where such losses are characterized as direct damages) arising out of or in any way related to the relationship and/or dealings between Niagara and Carrier regardless of whether the claim under which damages are sought is based upon contract, tort, negligence, strict liability or otherwise, and regardless of whether the parties have been advised of the possibility of such damages at the time of contracting or otherwise. Under no circumstances shall Niagara’s maximum total liability, if any, arising out of or in any way related to the relationship and/or dealings between Niagara and Carrier exceed the amounts paid and/or due to Carrier by Niagara under any relationship between the Parties, Award, agreement or purchase order.
Liability for Loss, Damage or Delay to Loads. a) Carrier agrees that in the transportation of all Loads hereunder, it shall assume, and does assume, the liability of an interstate motor carrier, as provided by 49 U.S.C. § 14706, with such liability to exist from the time of the receipt of any of said goods by Carrier until proper delivery has been made to the location specified by Niagara.

All claims will be filed and resolved in accordance with the ICC regulations in 49 CFR Part 370. b) All Loads tendered to Carrier for transportation will be palletized and stretch wrapped. Carrier reserves the right to refuse to accept any Load that is not so packaged. c) Parties agree that each incident of transportation of product under any Award, agreement or purchase order shall be evidenced by a BOL signed by Carrier and Niagara showing the kind, quantity, value and condition of products or goods received and delivered by Carrier at the loading and unloading points respectively. Carrier’s duties and responsibilities under any Award, agreement or purchase order between the Parties for the transport of any Load evidenced by such receipt shall commence when Carrier takes possession and control of Niagara’s property or upon execution of such receipt by Niagara, whichever occurs first, and shall end when consignee/customer/buyer signs a delivery receipt and Carrier delivers Niagara’s property. Carrier shall inspect all Loads prior to accepting possession and control and shall document any evidence of damage on the BOL. If Carrier does not indicate damage on the BOL at the time of possession and immediately communicates the existence of such damage to Niagara, Carrier agrees that damage documented upon delivery presumptively occurred while the Load was in Carrier’s custody and possession. d) The time limit within which Niagara must file a claim for damaged or lost products or goods against Carrier shall be nine (9) months from the date of delivery or within nine (9) months of the reasonably anticipated date of delivery in the event of a complete loss. All claims shall be paid, settled or disallowed by Carrier within ninety (90) days of filing. Disallowance shall state a lawful reason for declining to accept responsibility for the claim, and shall be stated by Carrier, not its insurer. In no event shall Niagara be required to work with Carrier’s insurer directly. Niagara agrees to immediately provide written notice of claim to Carrier showing kind, quantity, value and proof of carriage as evidenced by a signed BOL. e) In the event of Carrier’s breach, or alleged breach, as determined solely by Niagara, of any provision in any Award, agreement or purchase order between the Parties, in addition to all other remedies in law or equity that are available to Niagara, Carrier shall be responsible for all reasonable attorneys’ fees and costs incurred by Niagara as a result of said breach or alleged breach.
Product Loss or Damage. a) Rejected Load. In the event the Niagara’s customer rejects the delivery of any Load due to the fault of Carrier, Carrier must return the Load to the pick-up origin designated by Niagara at no cost. In the event Niagara’s customer rejects the delivery of a Load due to no fault of the Carrier, Niagara shall pay a transportation rate equal to the rate Niagara paid Carrier to transport the Load to Niagara’s customer. Any and all rejected Loads not scheduled for redelivery must be delivered back to Niagara’s pick-up origin within five (5) days from the time/date of initial pick-up. Any Load being transported back to Niagara’s pick-up origin must be secured with either a seal or padlock and a confirmation must be sent via email to executionteam@niagarawater.com. Return charges for shorthaul clusters will be returned at half the published rate of the Load. For long haul cluster freight, return charges will not exceed the total all-in rate of the Load. b) Visual Damage to Products. 1) For damages to individual cases of product up to less than one pallet, Niagara’s customer must note the damage on the BOL, and customer or Carrier may dispose of or donate damaged cases of product. 2) For damage to one or more pallets, Niagara’s customer must note the damage on the BOL. If the Load is rejected and remains in the custody of Carrier, Carrier must immediately contact Niagara Dispatch for deposition instructions. Carrier must provide the purchase order number, date and time of single delivery, number of pallets damaged and/or refused, bottle code, any photographs, a brief description of the damage, and contact information, including contact name, phone number, email and facsimile number. c) Concealed Damage to Products. If Niagara’s customer reports concealed damage to the product, pallet and/or Load, such damage will be investigated to determine liability. If the investigation concludes that Carrier is responsible for the damage, Carrier will be notified of Niagara’s intent to file a claim and will be given the opportunity to inspect the product, pallet, or Load prior to disposition for disposal or donation. d) Product Loss/Delay. In the event Carrier is unable to execute delivery for reasons such as theft of Load, vehicular accident, or delay impacting the product’s integrity (i.e., non-delivery of Load/products to its specified destination within five (5) calendar days), recovery of loss will be executed pursuant to 49 CFR 370. e) Donation/Disposal. Due to product liability, trademark protection, and/or licensing agreements for private label stock, any distressed, damaged or otherwise rejected shipment that is not returned to a Niagara facility, for whatever reason, must be properly disposed of or donated in accordance with Niagara’s express written instruction. IN NO CIRCUMSTANCE CAN ANY GOODS, PRODUCTS OR INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY EVER BE RE-SOLD. Carrier understands and agrees that in no event shall Carrier nor any Carrier Actors, without the prior express written consent of Niagara: (i) cause, suffer or permit the transfer, salvage, disposal and/or donation of any Goods, Products or Intellectual Property, and/or (ii) offer to transfer, salvage, dispose of and/or donate any Goods, Products or Intellectual Property, whether as salvage or otherwise. Notwithstanding the foregoing, if there is a distressed, damaged or otherwise rejected Load of product that is not returned to a Niagara facility, and Niagara gives express written permission to a Carrier to dispose of or donate the goods or products, Niagara shall require written verification, signed by the Carrier’s authorized agent, which provides exact details as to the final disposition as well as copies of donation/disposal receipts as backup. f) Claim Settlement. In order to close a freight claim as settled, one of the following conclusions must be obtained: • Granted: paid in full • Declined: written declination including a specific legal reason • Compromised: written offer to settle for less than the original claim amount, including legal rationale for offer to pay less than full amount claimed g) Payment. Any and all payments from Carrier to Niagara in settlement of a claim must be made, in full, and sent to: Niagara Bottling, LLC 2560 E. Philadelphia Street Ontario, CA 91761 Attention: Claims Specialist Niagara’s claim reference number must appear on the check. A partial payment check will not be accepted and will not be cashed as a granted or settled claim.
Seals. Carrier agrees to comply with the Food and Drug Administration and industry standards with regard to seals as codified in FDA 21 CFR 110.93, which states that all transportation of food shall be under conditions to protect that food. Storage and transportation of finished food shall be under conditions that will protect the food against physical, chemical, and microbial contamination as well as against deterioration of the food and the container, Carrier further agrees to use standard industry practices, including, but not limited to ensuring that any and all trailers from or on behalf of Niagara will be kept sealed while transporting all goods. Carrier must confirm that the seal has been secured on the trailer and that the seal number is recorded on the BOL by Niagara prior to leaving any of Niagara’s facilities. If the seal is required to be broken at any time during transport, Carrier must first seek Niagara’s authorization. Carrier must then notify Niagara that the trailer has been re-sealed by sending an e-mail to executionteam@niagarawater.com. In the event Niagara’s customer breaks the seal, rejects the Load, and does not provide Carrier with a new seal to re-seal the trailer, Niagara’s customer or Carrier must add a lock to the trailer to secure the Load. It is Carrier’s sole responsibility to ensure that the trailer is re-sealed or a lock is added to the trailer prior to leaving Niagara’s customer’s facilities. No Loads will be accepted by Niagara without a seal or lock on the trailer.
Insurance. During the term of all Awards, agreements or purchase orders, and after any termination of or expiration, and for as long as Carrier owes any obligation to Niagara and/or any statute of limitations for any potential claim that Niagara may have against Carrier remains unexpired, Carrier and any Carrier Actors shall maintain all insurance and/or bonds required by statute, law and any Award, agreement or purchase order with minimum insurance limits consistent with Niagara’s insurance requirements set forth at the end of this Section 16. Should insurance policy limits be exhausted or should Carrier or any Carrier Actors fail to maintain the required insurance coverage, neither Carrier nor any Carrier Actor will in any way be relieved from liability provided for herein to Niagara should a loss occur. Carrier shall furnish Niagara with a certificate evidencing the aforementioned coverage limits via email to insurancecerts@niagarawater.com. Such certificate shall provide for thirty (30) days written notice to Niagara in the event of cancellation. All certificates of insurance shall name Niagara Bottling, LLC and its parents, subsidiaries, employees, agents, affiliates and assigns as an additional insured by policy endorsement (on both Carrier’s General Liability Policy, Automobile Liability Policy and Cargo Insurance Policy) and waive all rights of subrogation against Niagara, its parent, director, officers, employees, stockholders, subsidiaries and affiliates with regard to Employee Liability and Workers Compensation. For any claims relating to an Agreement, agreement or purchase order, the Carrier’s insurance shall be deemed to be primary and not contributing to or in excess of any similar coverage purchased by Niagara. Carrier hereby acknowledges that naming Niagara Bottling, LLC and its parents, subsidiaries, employees, agents, affiliates and assigns as an additional insured by policy endorsement is a condition precedent to payment by Niagara. For the avoidance of doubt, Niagara will not be required to submit payment until the requirements of this provision have been met. However, failure of Niagara to demand any certificates or to identify any deficiency in the insurance provided shall not be construed as or deemed to be a waiver of the Carrier’s (or its agents or subcontractors) obligation to maintain such insurance. If any of the coverages are required to remain in force after termination of the Agreement, Carrier shall submit additional certificates evidencing continuation of coverage until such obligation ends. Niagara’s Minimum Insurance Requirements: Commercial General Liability $2,000,000 per occurrence; $5,000,000 aggregate Auto Liability $3,000,000 combined single limit Cargo $100,000 Employee Liability/Workman’s Comp $2,000,000/Statutory In addition to the general insurance requirements provided in the above table, customized insurance requirements for specific Seller-types are attached hereto and incorporated herein by this reference.
Termination. a) Any Award, agreement or purchase order shall commence on the date such Award is given, agreement is entered into or purchase order is issued, and shall automatically renew on a year-to-year basis until terminated, provided that Carrier is performing in accordance with these Carrier Standard T&C’s, the Award, agreement or purchase order, and that Carrier continues to provide Niagara the lowest available rates in the market and the lowest rates and/or most favorable terms at which Carrier offers its service to any third party shipper in the same functional level of the trade as Niagara (“Most Favorable Rates”). The Parties agree to meet in good faith to discuss existing rates at a time no earlier than twelve (12) months after the Award is issued or an agreement is entered into by the Parties. Such discussions may result in a rate adjustment if, and only if, the adjustment is in reference to driver pay, and only upon mutual written consent by both Parties. Notwithstanding the foregoing, Carrier guarantees that any rate increase will not exceed 2% of the current rate. In the event that Carrier does not provide Niagara with the Most Favorable Rates, Niagara shall have the right to terminate by giving thirty (30) days written notice to Carrier. b) If during the term specified by any Award, agreement, or purchase order either party (i) files a petition in bankruptcy or has a petition in bankruptcy filed against it that is not dismissed within sixty (60) days, or (ii) makes a general assignment for the benefit of creditors, then in any such case the non-bankrupt party may terminate any Award, agreement or purchase order by giving written notice of such effect to the bankrupt party. c) If all or any portion of Carrier’s registration, as required by any Award, agreement or purchase order, is revoked, canceled, suspended, or discontinued by operation of law or otherwise (“Registration Issue”), or if Carrier’s insurance policies are canceled, reduced or otherwise invalidated (“Insurance Issue”), Carrier shall promptly notify Niagara, and in no case later than forty-eight (48) hours after Carrier learns of any such Registration or Insurance Issue and Niagara shall have the right to terminate any Award, agreement or purchase order immediately and/ or collect reimbursement for all expenses it has incurred in preparation of and/ or as a result of any Award, agreement or purchase order from Carrier. Carrier’s notification to Niagara in regards to the above shall in no way serve as a waiver by Niagara of its right to construe such as a breach of any Award, agreement or purchase order and shall in no way limit Niagara’s right to pursue all remedies in law or equity as a result of such breach. d) If, in Niagara’s sole discretion, delays in transportation cause inconvenience and/or harm to Niagara’s business interests, or Carrier is otherwise in breach of any Award, agreement or purchase order, Niagara shall provide written notice to Carrier outlining the delay and resulting or anticipated harm and/or breach. If the deficiencies and/or breach remain following a period of thirty (30) days from the date written notice was provided, as is measured as of the date specified on the notice, Niagara may terminate any Award, agreement or purchase order upon thirty (30) days written notice to Carrier. e) In the event of any discontinuation and/or revision to any regulations and/or laws in the United States (or any other country where Carrier services Niagara), and/or if Niagara, in its sole discretion, determines that the services contemplated in any Award, agreement or purchase order are no longer necessary or required and/or that Niagara’s course of business strategy has changed, Niagara may terminate any Award, agreement or purchase order in part or in its entirety upon sixty (60) days’ notice to Carrier. f) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary herein, Niagara shall have the ability to terminate any Award, agreement or purchase order for convenience with a sixty (60) day written notice, and Carrier shall have the ability to terminate any Award or agreement with one hundred eighty (180) day written notice to Niagara.

In the event Niagara requests Carrier to haul 20% more of its projected daily volume, Carrier shall comply with such a request. In the event Carrier is unable to haul Niagara’s scale and weighted Load, causing Niagara to remove any products or pallets, Carrier agrees that Niagara may deduct a fee of $100 per occurrence from Carrier’s corresponding purchase order. d) Equipment.

Additionally, if Carrier cannot provide the POD within fourteen (14) days of delivery, Niagara may charge Carrier for the cost of any of Niagara’s customer’s invoice for product not paid. Alternatively, if Niagara receives a refusal to pay for a Load from its customer, Niagara will provide Carrier of evidence of customer refusal and proof of loss, and shall charge Carrier the cost of customer’s invoice for product.
Assignment and Subcontracting. Carrier agrees not to interline, use other motor carriers or brokers, or to use “substituted services” or otherwise assign or subcontract any portion of any Award, agreement or purchase order without the express written consent of Niagara. If, with the express written permission of Niagara, Carrier elects to use a delivery agent or subcontract the transportation of a Load, Carrier shall be the sole bearer of any costs associated with the delivery agent or subcontractor and agrees to be fully liable for any loss, damage, or delay to transportation of any such Loads while in this third party carrier’s care, custody and/or control. Carrier understands and agrees that all payments made by Niagara are conditioned upon Niagara’s receipt of a conditional waiver and release executed by Carrier and an unconditional waiver and release executed by each Additional Party.

Niagara’s delay, failure or partial exercise of any provision herein or waiver of any breach, right or remedy contained in or granted by any Award, agreement or purchase order shall not be deemed a waiver of any breach, right or remedy unless expressly stated as such by Niagara in writing signed by an authorized representative of Niagara, and then such waiver shall be limited solely to its specific terms.
Limitation of Liability. In no event shall Niagara be liable for any punitive, exemplary, special, incidental, indirect or consequential damages of any kind (including, but not limited to loss of profits, loss of reputation, and/or loss of current or prospective business advantage, when where such losses are characterized as direct damages) arising out of or in any way related to the relationship and/or dealings between Niagara and Carrier regardless of whether the claim under which damages are sought is based upon contract, tort, negligence, strict liability or otherwise, and regardless of whether the parties have been advised of the possibility of such damages at the time of contracting or otherwise. Under no circumstances shall Niagara’s maximum total liability, if any, arising out of or in any way related to the relationship and/or dealings between Niagara and Carrier exceed the amounts paid and/or due to Carrier by Niagara under any relationship between the Parties, Award, agreement or purchase order.
Liability for Loss, Damage or Delay to Loads. a) Carrier agrees that in the transportation of all Loads hereunder, it shall assume, and does assume, the liability of an interstate motor carrier, as provided by 49 U.S.C. § 14706, with such liability to exist from the time of the receipt of any of said goods by Carrier until proper delivery has been made to the location specified by Niagara. The Parties expressly decline to limit the value of the property as permitted by 49 U.S.C. § 14706(c). All claims will be filed and resolved in accordance with the ICC regulations in 49 CFR Part 370. b) All Loads tendered to Carrier for transportation will be palletized and stretch wrapped. Carrier reserves the right to refuse to accept any Load that is not so packaged. c) Parties agree that each incident of transportation of product under any Award, agreement or purchase order shall be evidenced by a BOL signed by Carrier and Niagara showing the kind, quantity, value and condition of products or goods received and delivered by Carrier at the loading and unloading points respectively. Carrier’s duties and responsibilities under any Award, agreement or purchase order between the Parties for the transport of any Load evidenced by such receipt shall commence when Carrier takes possession and control of Niagara’s property or upon execution of such receipt by Niagara, whichever occurs first, and shall end when consignee/customer/buyer signs a delivery receipt and Carrier delivers Niagara’s property. Carrier shall inspect all Loads prior to accepting possession and control and shall document any evidence of damage on the BOL. If Carrier does not indicate damage on the BOL at the time of possession and immediately communicates the existence of such damage to Niagara, Carrier agrees that damage documented upon delivery presumptively occurred while the Load was in Carrier’s custody and possession. d) The time limit within which Niagara must file a claim for damaged or lost products or goods against Carrier shall be nine (9) months from the date of delivery or within nine (9) months of the reasonably anticipated date of delivery in the event of a complete loss. All claims shall be paid, settled or disallowed by Carrier within ninety (90) days of filing. Disallowance shall state a lawful reason for declining to accept responsibility for the claim, and shall be stated by Carrier, not its insurer. In no event shall Niagara be required to work with Carrier’s insurer directly. Niagara agrees to immediately provide written notice of claim to Carrier showing kind, quantity, value and proof of carriage as evidenced by a signed BOL. e) In the event of Carrier’s breach, or alleged breach, as determined solely by Niagara, of any provision in any Award, agreement or purchase order between the Parties, in addition to all other remedies in law or equity that are available to Niagara, Carrier shall be responsible for all reasonable attorneys’ fees and costs incurred by Niagara as a result of said breach or alleged breach.
Product Loss or Damage. a) Rejected Load. In the event the Niagara’s customer rejects the delivery of any Load due to the fault of Carrier, Carrier must return the Load to the pick-up origin designated by Niagara at no cost. In the event Niagara’s customer rejects the delivery of a Load due to no fault of the Carrier, Niagara shall pay a transportation rate equal to the rate Niagara paid Carrier to transport the Load to Niagara’s customer. Any and all rejected Loads not scheduled for redelivery must be delivered back to Niagara’s pick-up origin within five (5) days from the time/date of initial pick-up. Any Load being transported back to Niagara’s pick-up origin must be secured with either a seal or padlock and a confirmation must be sent via email to executionteam@niagarawater.com. Return charges for shorthaul clusters will be returned at half the published rate of the Load. For long haul cluster freight, return charges will not exceed the total all-in rate of the Load. b) Visual Damage to Products. 1) For damages to individual cases of product up to less than one pallet, Niagara’s customer must note the damage on the BOL, and customer or Carrier may dispose of or donate damaged cases of product. 2) For damage to one or more pallets, Niagara’s customer must note the damage on the BOL. If the Load is rejected and remains in the custody of Carrier, Carrier must immediately contact Niagara Dispatch for deposition instructions. Carrier must provide the purchase order number, date and time of single delivery, number of pallets damaged and/or refused, bottle code, any photographs, a brief description of the damage, and contact information, including contact name, phone number, email and facsimile number. c) Concealed Damage to Products. If Niagara’s customer reports concealed damage to the product, pallet and/or Load, such damage will be investigated to determine liability. If the investigation concludes that Carrier is responsible for the damage, Carrier will be notified of Niagara’s intent to file a claim and will be given the opportunity to inspect the product, pallet, or Load prior to disposition for disposal or donation. d) Product Loss/Delay. In the event Carrier is unable to execute delivery for reasons such as theft of Load, vehicular accident, or delay impacting the product’s integrity (i.e., non-delivery of Load/products to its specified destination within five (5) calendar days), recovery of loss will be executed pursuant to 49 CFR 370. e) Donation/Disposal. Due to product liability, trademark protection, and/or licensing agreements for private label stock, any distressed, damaged or otherwise rejected shipment that is not returned to a Niagara facility, for whatever reason, must be properly disposed of or donated in accordance with Niagara’s express written instruction. IN NO CIRCUMSTANCE CAN ANY GOODS, PRODUCTS OR INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY EVER BE RE-SOLD. Carrier understands and agrees that in no event shall Carrier nor any Carrier Actors, without the prior express written consent of Niagara: (i) cause, suffer or permit the transfer, salvage, disposal and/or donation of any Goods, Products or Intellectual Property, and/or (ii) offer to transfer, salvage, dispose of and/or donate any Goods, Products or Intellectual Property, whether as salvage or otherwise. Notwithstanding the foregoing, if there is a distressed, damaged or otherwise rejected Load of product that is not returned to a Niagara facility, and Niagara gives express written permission to a Carrier to dispose of or donate the goods or products, Niagara shall require written verification, signed by the Carrier’s authorized agent, which provides exact details as to the final disposition as well as copies of donation/disposal receipts as backup. f) Claim Settlement. In order to close a freight claim as settled, one of the following conclusions must be obtained: • Granted: paid in full • Declined: written declination including a specific legal reason • Compromised: written offer to settle for less than the original claim amount, including legal rationale for offer to pay less than full amount claimed g) Payment. Any and all payments from Carrier to Niagara in settlement of a claim must be made, in full, and sent to: Niagara Bottling, LLC 2560 E. Philadelphia Street Ontario, CA 91761 Attention: Claims Specialist Niagara’s claim reference number must appear on the check. A partial payment check will not be accepted and will not be cashed as a granted or settled claim.
Seals. Carrier agrees to comply with the Food and Drug Administration and industry standards with regard to seals as codified in FDA 21 CFR 110.93, which states that all transportation of food shall be under conditions to protect that food. Storage and transportation of finished food shall be under conditions that will protect the food against physical, chemical, and microbial contamination as well as against deterioration of the food and the container, Carrier further agrees to use standard industry practices, including, but not limited to ensuring that any and all trailers from or on behalf of Niagara will be kept sealed while transporting all goods. Carrier must confirm that the seal has been secured on the trailer and that the seal number is recorded on the BOL by Niagara prior to leaving any of Niagara’s facilities. If the seal is required to be broken at any time during transport, Carrier must first seek Niagara’s authorization. Carrier must then notify Niagara that the trailer has been re-sealed by sending an e-mail to executionteam@niagarawater.com. In the event Niagara’s customer breaks the seal, rejects the Load, and does not provide Carrier with a new seal to re-seal the trailer, Niagara’s customer or Carrier must add a lock to the trailer to secure the Load. It is Carrier’s sole responsibility to ensure that the trailer is re-sealed or a lock is added to the trailer prior to leaving Niagara’s customer’s facilities. No Loads will be accepted by Niagara without a seal or lock on the trailer.
Insurance. During the term of all Awards, agreements or purchase orders, and after any termination of or expiration, and for as long as Carrier owes any obligation to Niagara and/or any statute of limitations for any potential claim that Niagara may have against Carrier remains unexpired, Carrier and any Carrier Actors shall maintain all insurance and/or bonds required by statute, law and any Award, agreement or purchase order with minimum insurance limits consistent with Niagara’s insurance requirements set forth at the end of this Section 16. Should insurance policy limits be exhausted or should Carrier or any Carrier Actors fail to maintain the required insurance coverage, neither Carrier nor any Carrier Actor will in any way be relieved from liability provided for herein to Niagara should a loss occur. Carrier shall furnish Niagara with a certificate evidencing the aforementioned coverage limits via email to insurancecerts@niagarawater.com. Such certificate shall provide for thirty (30) days written notice to Niagara in the event of cancellation. All certificates of insurance shall name Niagara Bottling, LLC and its parents, subsidiaries, employees, agents, affiliates and assigns as an additional insured by policy endorsement (on both Carrier’s General Liability Policy, Automobile Liability Policy and Cargo Insurance Policy) and waive all rights of subrogation against Niagara, its parent, director, officers, employees, stockholders, subsidiaries and affiliates with regard to Employee Liability and Workers Compensation. For any claims relating to an Agreement, agreement or purchase order, the Carrier’s insurance shall be deemed to be primary and not contributing to or in excess of any similar coverage purchased by Niagara. Carrier hereby acknowledges that naming Niagara Bottling, LLC and its parents, subsidiaries, employees, agents, affiliates and assigns as an additional insured by policy endorsement is a condition precedent to payment by Niagara. For the avoidance of doubt, Niagara will not be required to submit payment until the requirements of this provision have been met. However, failure of Niagara to demand any certificates or to identify any deficiency in the insurance provided shall not be construed as or deemed to be a waiver of the Carrier’s (or its agents or subcontractors) obligation to maintain such insurance. If any of the coverages are required to remain in force after termination of the Agreement, Carrier shall submit additional certificates evidencing continuation of coverage until such obligation ends. Niagara’s Minimum Insurance Requirements: Commercial General Liability $2,000,000 per occurrence; $5,000,000 aggregate Auto Liability $3,000,000 combined single limit Cargo $100,000 Employee Liability/Workman’s Comp $2,000,000/Statutory In addition to the general insurance requirements provided in the above table, customized insurance requirements for specific Seller-types are attached hereto and incorporated herein by this reference.
Termination. a) Any Award, agreement or purchase order shall commence on the date such Award is given, agreement is entered into or purchase order is issued, and shall automatically renew on a year-to-year basis until terminated, provided that Carrier is performing in accordance with these Carrier Standard T&C’s, the Award, agreement or purchase order, and that Carrier continues to provide Niagara the lowest available rates in the market and the lowest rates and/or most favorable terms at which Carrier offers its service to any third party shipper in the same functional level of the trade as Niagara (“Most Favorable Rates”). The Parties agree to meet in good faith to discuss existing rates at a time no earlier than twelve (12) months after the Award is issued or an agreement is entered into by the Parties. Such discussions may result in a rate adjustment if, and only if, the adjustment is in reference to driver pay, and only upon mutual written consent by both Parties. Notwithstanding the foregoing, Carrier guarantees that any rate increase will not exceed 2% of the current rate. In the event that Carrier does not provide Niagara with the Most Favorable Rates, Niagara shall have the right to terminate by giving thirty (30) days written notice to Carrier. b) If during the term specified by any Award, agreement, or purchase order either party (i) files a petition in bankruptcy or has a petition in bankruptcy filed against it that is not dismissed within sixty (60) days, or (ii) makes a general assignment for the benefit of creditors, then in any such case the non-bankrupt party may terminate any Award, agreement or purchase order by giving written notice of such effect to the bankrupt party. c) If all or any portion of Carrier’s registration, as required by any Award, agreement or purchase order, is revoked, canceled, suspended, or discontinued by operation of law or otherwise (“Registration Issue”), or if Carrier’s insurance policies are canceled, reduced or otherwise invalidated (“Insurance Issue”), Carrier shall promptly notify Niagara, and in no case later than forty-eight (48) hours after Carrier learns of any such Registration or Insurance Issue and Niagara shall have the right to terminate any Award, agreement or purchase order immediately and/ or collect reimbursement for all expenses it has incurred in preparation of and/ or as a result of any Award, agreement or purchase order from Carrier. Carrier’s notification to Niagara in regards to the above shall in no way serve as a waiver by Niagara of its right to construe such as a breach of any Award, agreement or purchase order and shall in no way limit Niagara’s right to pursue all remedies in law or equity as a result of such breach. d) If, in Niagara’s sole discretion, delays in transportation cause inconvenience and/or harm to Niagara’s business interests, or Carrier is otherwise in breach of any Award, agreement or purchase order, Niagara shall provide written notice to Carrier outlining the delay and resulting or anticipated harm and/or breach. If the deficiencies and/or breach remain following a period of thirty (30) days from the date written notice was provided, as is measured as of the date specified on the notice, Niagara may terminate any Award, agreement or purchase order upon thirty (30) days written notice to Carrier. e) In the event of any discontinuation and/or revision to any regulations and/or laws in the United States (or any other country where Carrier services Niagara), and/or if Niagara, in its sole discretion, determines that the services contemplated in any Award, agreement or purchase order are no longer necessary or required and/or that Niagara’s course of business strategy has changed, Niagara may terminate any Award, agreement or purchase order in part or in its entirety upon sixty (60) days’ notice to Carrier. f) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary herein, Niagara shall have the ability to terminate any Award, agreement or purchase order for convenience with a sixty (60) day written notice, and Carrier shall have the ability to terminate any Award or agreement with one hundred eighty (180) day written notice to Niagara.

Should Niagara provide an Award to Carrier for additional Lanes and/or Loads to provide Transportation Services to, such additional Award will be subject to these Standard Carrier T&C’s.
Payment Terms. Prior to commencement of Transportation Services, and in order to receive payment from Niagara, Carrier must provide Niagara with a Certificate of Insurance (COI) in accordance with Section 16 herein. Carrier shall only invoice Niagara for awarded Lanes and/or Loads received from Niagara. Such invoice and all supporting documents shall be submitted promptly, following transport of any Load to Niagara via email at truckingbackup@niagarawater.com. Such invoices must include Carrier’s name and invoice number in the subject line. Each email shall only include one (1) invoice per email submission.

Any and all payments by Niagara shall be deemed effective as of the date of postmark. Niagara shall have no liability for invoices that are not received within ninety (90) days of transport of any Load. Niagara shall have no liability for added, balance due, accessorial or any other charges of any nature which are not provided by the Award and which are not submitted within ninety (90) days from date of transport of a Load.

Carrier Performance. Carrier understands that all Transportation Services must be performed in a timely fashion. Carrier is solely responsible for scheduling and complying with any and all deliveries and delivery times as requested by Niagara’s customers. a) Pick-up of Loads. Carrier shall maintain a monthly on-time pick up appoint rate of a minimum of 90% from the designated Niagara facility through the entire term of the Award. If Carrier’s monthly pick-up rate falls below 90%, Carrier agrees to a $50 fee for every late pick-up appointment for the previous month that caused Carrier to fall below the 90% pick-up rate. b) Delivery of Loads. Carrier shall maintain a 98% monthly rate for on-time delivery of Loads through the entire term of the Award. On-time delivery of Loads shall mean Loads delivered within thirty (30) minutes of a scheduled delivery appointment time. If Carrier’s monthly on-time delivery rate to Niagara or its customer’s locations falls below 98%, Carrier agrees to a $100 fee for every late and/or missed delivery appointment for the previous month that caused Carrier to fall below the 98% delivery rate. c) Payload: Carrier warrants that it has the ability to ship Loads that are 45,600 pounds or less. Niagara may scale and weigh all Loads and shall provide a pallet count for all Loads. In accepting any Load, Carrier agrees to count all pallet quantities prior to sealing the trailer. Niagara will make its best effort to produce a tactical forecast of the projected volume of Loads and weights for the upcoming month. In the event Niagara requests Carrier to haul 20% more of its projected daily volume, Carrier shall comply with such a request. In the event Carrier is unable to haul Niagara’s scale and weighted Load, causing Niagara to remove any products or pallets, Carrier agrees that Niagara may deduct a fee of $100 per occurrence from Carrier’s corresponding purchase order. d) Equipment. Carrier shall ensure that all equipment used in connection with performing Transporting Services be clean, odor-free, dry, leak-proof, and free of contamination and/or infestation. Carrier warrants that no motor vehicle, trailer, tractor or other equipment that will be used for Transportation Services for Niagara has been used to transport refuse, garbage, trash or solid or liquid waste of any kind, or any types of hazardous materials.

Carrier, at its sole expense, must maintain and make available a telephone line for customer service to Niagara. Such customer service line will be operational twenty-four hours a day, seven days a week, and shall respond within thirty (30) minutes of contact by Niagara.
Documentation. With respect to the following documents, Carrier agrees to maintain the documents as follows: a) Daily reports: Carrier shall provide Niagara daily reports regarding the status of all Loads and delivery times; b) Proof of Delivery (POD): Carrier shall provide Niagara free of charge with any and all PODs within 48-hours of delivery of any Load, and shall maintain all such PODs for at least twelve (12) months from the date of delivery, or for a period as proscribed by law; c) Bill of Lading (BOL): Carrier agrees that Niagara’s bill of lading shall be considered: (i) an acceptable form of receipt hereunder, and (ii) specific shipping instructions. These Standard Carrier T&C’s shall be incorporated by reference into each and every such BOL and in the event of an inconsistency, these Standard Carrier T&C’s shall control; and d) Supporting documents for Accessorial charges: Carrier agrees to provide all documents in accordance with Section 18 of these Standard Terms and Conditions.
Carrier Failure to provide Proof of Delivery (POD). In the event Carrier fails to provide a POD within 48 hours of delivery, Niagara shall have the right to deduct all amounts paid for Transportation Services, or demand payment for the amount of the Transportation Service invoice. Additionally, if Carrier cannot provide the POD within fourteen (14) days of delivery, Niagara may charge Carrier for the cost of any of Niagara’s customer’s invoice for product not paid. Alternatively, if Niagara receives a refusal to pay for a Load from its customer, Niagara will provide Carrier of evidence of customer refusal and proof of loss, and shall charge Carrier the cost of customer’s invoice for product.
Assignment and Subcontracting. Carrier agrees not to interline, use other motor carriers or brokers, or to use “substituted services” or otherwise assign or subcontract any portion of any Award, agreement or purchase order without the express written consent of Niagara. If, with the express written permission of Niagara, Carrier elects to use a delivery agent or subcontract the transportation of a Load, Carrier shall be the sole bearer of any costs associated with the delivery agent or subcontractor and agrees to be fully liable for any loss, damage, or delay to transportation of any such Loads while in this third party carrier’s care, custody and/or control. Carrier understands and agrees that all payments made by Niagara are conditioned upon Niagara’s receipt of a conditional waiver and release executed by Carrier and an unconditional waiver and release executed by each Additional Party. Carrier agrees to defend, indemnify and hold Niagara and its customer’s harmless from any and all claims of any Additional Party for payment. Carrier acknowledges and agrees that Carrier shall remain, at all times, fully liable for all Additional Parties. Carrier warrants that it shall ensure that Additional Parties comply with and adhere to all warranties, representations, obligations, terms and conditions contained herein.
Compliance with Law. At all times during the Award or agreement term or its relationship with Niagara, Carrier shall comply with all applicable state and federal laws. Additionally, Carrier shall operate all Carrier Equipment in compliance with industry standard, and shall maintain and operate the same such that Carrier’s safety rating does not fall below “satisfactory” under the Federal Motor Carrier Safety Administration standards. In the event that Carrier’s safety rating falls below a “satisfactory”, Carrier shall notify Niagara immediately, and Niagara will have the immediate right to terminate any Award, agreement or purchase order upon notice to Carrier.
Indemnification: a) Carrier agrees to indemnify, defend, and hold Niagara, its affiliates, and representatives harmless from and against any and all claims arising out of or related to any Award, agreement, or purchase order and/or Transportation Services that are the subject thereof, including but not limited to: (i) any bodily injury or property damage claims, and any liability, loss, cost, expense, or other damages (including reasonable attorney fees) brought about by any injury of any kind suffered by any person or property as a result of any act, neglect, default, omission of either the Carrier, Carrier’s agents, employees, affiliates, subcontractors, or any third party for whose actions Carrier is responsible (“Carrier Actors”), or Niagara, Niagara’s agents, employees, affiliates, subcontractors or other representatives; (ii) any negligent act, misfeasance, or nonfeasance by Carrier, or Carrier Actors; (iii) any harm, injury, damage, or loss arising out of or in connection with the Transportation Services provided; (iv) third party consumer claims, suits, and/or demands, including costs and expenses of investigation and settlement and attorneys’ fees and expenses, to the extent such claims arise from: (a) any act or omission by Carrier or Carrier Actors relating to or affecting the condition, quality, or character of any Goods or Services provided; or (b) trademark, copyright, trade dress, or patent infringement. Carrier acknowledges and agrees that Carrier must receive Niagara’s express written approval prior to settling any claim or lawsuit. Niagara reserves the right at any time to control its own defense. b) Should Carrier receive (or become aware of) any demand, service of process, notice, action, settlement, summons, complaint or the like from or by a third party alleging that a Party hereto is responsible for some injury, act, omission, breach, negligence, claim, loss, violation of law, settlement, cost, expense, obligation, liability, damage, recovery, deficiency or otherwise, including, without limitation, interest, penalties, reasonable attorney fees and costs (each, a “Claim”) that arises out of, results from, or in any way relates to the subject matter of these Standard Terms and Conditions, an Award, agreement or purchase order, then Carrier shall immediately (but no later than five (5) business days after receipt, or becoming aware, of a third party Claim) provide Niagara with written notice regarding each third party Claim of which Carrier is or becomes aware. Carrier covenants and agrees that should Carrier fail to provide Niagara with timely written notice regarding any third party Claim, Carrier hereby generally and expressly waives, relinquishes and releases, and agrees to hold harmless, Niagara from and against any and all Claims capable of being asserted by Carrier against Niagara in connection therewith. c) In the event Carrier utilizes any party (“Additional Party”) regardless of that party’s legal designation of contractor, subcontractor, materials supplier, agent, or otherwise, for the purpose of performing any Transportation Services, Carrier shall submit to Niagara written notice of (i) each Additional Party, (ii) the duties each Additional Party will undertake, (iii) the amount of compensation each Additional Party is to receive from Carrier, and (iv) Carrier’s compensation schedule and payment terms with the Additional Party. Carrier understands submitting this written notice as set forth above is a condition precedent to payment. Such written notice must be sent to Vice President of Legal Affairs via email and certified mail (1) panderson@niagarawater.com, (2) 2560 E. Philadelphia St., Ontario, CA 91761. g) Waiver. Niagara’s delay, failure or partial exercise of any provision herein or waiver of any breach, right or remedy contained in or granted by any Award, agreement or purchase order shall not be deemed a waiver of any breach, right or remedy unless expressly stated as such by Niagara in writing signed by an authorized representative of Niagara, and then such waiver shall be limited solely to its specific terms.
Limitation of Liability. In no event shall Niagara be liable for any punitive, exemplary, special, incidental, indirect or consequential damages of any kind (including, but not limited to loss of profits, loss of reputation, and/or loss of current or prospective business advantage, when where such losses are characterized as direct damages) arising out of or in any way related to the relationship and/or dealings between Niagara and Carrier regardless of whether the claim under which damages are sought is based upon contract, tort, negligence, strict liability or otherwise, and regardless of whether the parties have been advised of the possibility of such damages at the time of contracting or otherwise. Under no circumstances shall Niagara’s maximum total liability, if any, arising out of or in any way related to the relationship and/or dealings between Niagara and Carrier exceed the amounts paid and/or due to Carrier by Niagara under any relationship between the Parties, Award, agreement or purchase order.
Liability for Loss, Damage or Delay to Loads. a) Carrier agrees that in the transportation of all Loads hereunder, it shall assume, and does assume, the liability of an interstate motor carrier, as provided by 49 U.S.C. § 14706, with such liability to exist from the time of the receipt of any of said goods by Carrier until proper delivery has been made to the location specified by Niagara. The Parties expressly decline to limit the value of the property as permitted by 49 U.S.C. § 14706(c). All claims will be filed and resolved in accordance with the ICC regulations in 49 CFR Part 370. b) All Loads tendered to Carrier for transportation will be palletized and stretch wrapped. Carrier reserves the right to refuse to accept any Load that is not so packaged. c) Parties agree that each incident of transportation of product under any Award, agreement or purchase order shall be evidenced by a BOL signed by Carrier and Niagara showing the kind, quantity, value and condition of products or goods received and delivered by Carrier at the loading and unloading points respectively. Carrier’s duties and responsibilities under any Award, agreement or purchase order between the Parties for the transport of any Load evidenced by such receipt shall commence when Carrier takes possession and control of Niagara’s property or upon execution of such receipt by Niagara, whichever occurs first, and shall end when consignee/customer/buyer signs a delivery receipt and Carrier delivers Niagara’s property. Carrier shall inspect all Loads prior to accepting possession and control and shall document any evidence of damage on the BOL. If Carrier does not indicate damage on the BOL at the time of possession and immediately communicates the existence of such damage to Niagara, Carrier agrees that damage documented upon delivery presumptively occurred while the Load was in Carrier’s custody and possession. d) The time limit within which Niagara must file a claim for damaged or lost products or goods against Carrier shall be nine (9) months from the date of delivery or within nine (9) months of the reasonably anticipated date of delivery in the event of a complete loss. All claims shall be paid, settled or disallowed by Carrier within ninety (90) days of filing. Disallowance shall state a lawful reason for declining to accept responsibility for the claim, and shall be stated by Carrier, not its insurer. In no event shall Niagara be required to work with Carrier’s insurer directly. Niagara agrees to immediately provide written notice of claim to Carrier showing kind, quantity, value and proof of carriage as evidenced by a signed BOL. e) In the event of Carrier’s breach, or alleged breach, as determined solely by Niagara, of any provision in any Award, agreement or purchase order between the Parties, in addition to all other remedies in law or equity that are available to Niagara, Carrier shall be responsible for all reasonable attorneys’ fees and costs incurred by Niagara as a result of said breach or alleged breach.
Product Loss or Damage. a) Rejected Load. In the event the Niagara’s customer rejects the delivery of any Load due to the fault of Carrier, Carrier must return the Load to the pick-up origin designated by Niagara at no cost. In the event Niagara’s customer rejects the delivery of a Load due to no fault of the Carrier, Niagara shall pay a transportation rate equal to the rate Niagara paid Carrier to transport the Load to Niagara’s customer. Any and all rejected Loads not scheduled for redelivery must be delivered back to Niagara’s pick-up origin within five (5) days from the time/date of initial pick-up. Any Load being transported back to Niagara’s pick-up origin must be secured with either a seal or padlock and a confirmation must be sent via email to executionteam@niagarawater.com. Return charges for shorthaul clusters will be returned at half the published rate of the Load. For long haul cluster freight, return charges will not exceed the total all-in rate of the Load. b) Visual Damage to Products. 1) For damages to individual cases of product up to less than one pallet, Niagara’s customer must note the damage on the BOL, and customer or Carrier may dispose of or donate damaged cases of product. 2) For damage to one or more pallets, Niagara’s customer must note the damage on the BOL. If the Load is rejected and remains in the custody of Carrier, Carrier must immediately contact Niagara Dispatch for deposition instructions. Carrier must provide the purchase order number, date and time of single delivery, number of pallets damaged and/or refused, bottle code, any photographs, a brief description of the damage, and contact information, including contact name, phone number, email and facsimile number. c) Concealed Damage to Products. If Niagara’s customer reports concealed damage to the product, pallet and/or Load, such damage will be investigated to determine liability. If the investigation concludes that Carrier is responsible for the damage, Carrier will be notified of Niagara’s intent to file a claim and will be given the opportunity to inspect the product, pallet, or Load prior to disposition for disposal or donation. d) Product Loss/Delay. In the event Carrier is unable to execute delivery for reasons such as theft of Load, vehicular accident, or delay impacting the product’s integrity (i.e., non-delivery of Load/products to its specified destination within five (5) calendar days), recovery of loss will be executed pursuant to 49 CFR 370. e) Donation/Disposal. Due to product liability, trademark protection, and/or licensing agreements for private label stock, any distressed, damaged or otherwise rejected shipment that is not returned to a Niagara facility, for whatever reason, must be properly disposed of or donated in accordance with Niagara’s express written instruction. IN NO CIRCUMSTANCE CAN ANY GOODS, PRODUCTS OR INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY EVER BE RE-SOLD. Carrier understands and agrees that in no event shall Carrier nor any Carrier Actors, without the prior express written consent of Niagara: (i) cause, suffer or permit the transfer, salvage, disposal and/or donation of any Goods, Products or Intellectual Property, and/or (ii) offer to transfer, salvage, dispose of and/or donate any Goods, Products or Intellectual Property, whether as salvage or otherwise. Notwithstanding the foregoing, if there is a distressed, damaged or otherwise rejected Load of product that is not returned to a Niagara facility, and Niagara gives express written permission to a Carrier to dispose of or donate the goods or products, Niagara shall require written verification, signed by the Carrier’s authorized agent, which provides exact details as to the final disposition as well as copies of donation/disposal receipts as backup. f) Claim Settlement. In order to close a freight claim as settled, one of the following conclusions must be obtained: • Granted: paid in full • Declined: written declination including a specific legal reason • Compromised: written offer to settle for less than the original claim amount, including legal rationale for offer to pay less than full amount claimed g) Payment. Any and all payments from Carrier to Niagara in settlement of a claim must be made, in full, and sent to: Niagara Bottling, LLC 2560 E. Philadelphia Street Ontario, CA 91761 Attention: Claims Specialist Niagara’s claim reference number must appear on the check. A partial payment check will not be accepted and will not be cashed as a granted or settled claim.
Seals. Carrier agrees to comply with the Food and Drug Administration and industry standards with regard to seals as codified in FDA 21 CFR 110.93, which states that all transportation of food shall be under conditions to protect that food. Storage and transportation of finished food shall be under conditions that will protect the food against physical, chemical, and microbial contamination as well as against deterioration of the food and the container, Carrier further agrees to use standard industry practices, including, but not limited to ensuring that any and all trailers from or on behalf of Niagara will be kept sealed while transporting all goods. Carrier must confirm that the seal has been secured on the trailer and that the seal number is recorded on the BOL by Niagara prior to leaving any of Niagara’s facilities. If the seal is required to be broken at any time during transport, Carrier must first seek Niagara’s authorization. Carrier must then notify Niagara that the trailer has been re-sealed by sending an e-mail to executionteam@niagarawater.com. In the event Niagara’s customer breaks the seal, rejects the Load, and does not provide Carrier with a new seal to re-seal the trailer, Niagara’s customer or Carrier must add a lock to the trailer to secure the Load. It is Carrier’s sole responsibility to ensure that the trailer is re-sealed or a lock is added to the trailer prior to leaving Niagara’s customer’s facilities. No Loads will be accepted by Niagara without a seal or lock on the trailer.
Insurance. During the term of all Awards, agreements or purchase orders, and after any termination of or expiration, and for as long as Carrier owes any obligation to Niagara and/or any statute of limitations for any potential claim that Niagara may have against Carrier remains unexpired, Carrier and any Carrier Actors shall maintain all insurance and/or bonds required by statute, law and any Award, agreement or purchase order with minimum insurance limits consistent with Niagara’s insurance requirements set forth at the end of this Section 16. Should insurance policy limits be exhausted or should Carrier or any Carrier Actors fail to maintain the required insurance coverage, neither Carrier nor any Carrier Actor will in any way be relieved from liability provided for herein to Niagara should a loss occur. Carrier shall furnish Niagara with a certificate evidencing the aforementioned coverage limits via email to insurancecerts@niagarawater.com. Such certificate shall provide for thirty (30) days written notice to Niagara in the event of cancellation. All certificates of insurance shall name Niagara Bottling, LLC and its parents, subsidiaries, employees, agents, affiliates and assigns as an additional insured by policy endorsement (on both Carrier’s General Liability Policy, Automobile Liability Policy and Cargo Insurance Policy) and waive all rights of subrogation against Niagara, its parent, director, officers, employees, stockholders, subsidiaries and affiliates with regard to Employee Liability and Workers Compensation. For any claims relating to an Agreement, agreement or purchase order, the Carrier’s insurance shall be deemed to be primary and not contributing to or in excess of any similar coverage purchased by Niagara. Carrier hereby acknowledges that naming Niagara Bottling, LLC and its parents, subsidiaries, employees, agents, affiliates and assigns as an additional insured by policy endorsement is a condition precedent to payment by Niagara. For the avoidance of doubt, Niagara will not be required to submit payment until the requirements of this provision have been met. However, failure of Niagara to demand any certificates or to identify any deficiency in the insurance provided shall not be construed as or deemed to be a waiver of the Carrier’s (or its agents or subcontractors) obligation to maintain such insurance. If any of the coverages are required to remain in force after termination of the Agreement, Carrier shall submit additional certificates evidencing continuation of coverage until such obligation ends. Niagara’s Minimum Insurance Requirements: Commercial General Liability $2,000,000 per occurrence; $5,000,000 aggregate Auto Liability $3,000,000 combined single limit Cargo $100,000 Employee Liability/Workman’s Comp $2,000,000/Statutory In addition to the general insurance requirements provided in the above table, customized insurance requirements for specific Seller-types are attached hereto and incorporated herein by this reference.
Termination. a) Any Award, agreement or purchase order shall commence on the date such Award is given, agreement is entered into or purchase order is issued, and shall automatically renew on a year-to-year basis until terminated, provided that Carrier is performing in accordance with these Carrier Standard T&C’s, the Award, agreement or purchase order, and that Carrier continues to provide Niagara the lowest available rates in the market and the lowest rates and/or most favorable terms at which Carrier offers its service to any third party shipper in the same functional level of the trade as Niagara (“Most Favorable Rates”). The Parties agree to meet in good faith to discuss existing rates at a time no earlier than twelve (12) months after the Award is issued or an agreement is entered into by the Parties. Such discussions may result in a rate adjustment if, and only if, the adjustment is in reference to driver pay, and only upon mutual written consent by both Parties. Notwithstanding the foregoing, Carrier guarantees that any rate increase will not exceed 2% of the current rate. In the event that Carrier does not provide Niagara with the Most Favorable Rates, Niagara shall have the right to terminate by giving thirty (30) days written notice to Carrier. b) If during the term specified by any Award, agreement, or purchase order either party (i) files a petition in bankruptcy or has a petition in bankruptcy filed against it that is not dismissed within sixty (60) days, or (ii) makes a general assignment for the benefit of creditors, then in any such case the non-bankrupt party may terminate any Award, agreement or purchase order by giving written notice of such effect to the bankrupt party. c) If all or any portion of Carrier’s registration, as required by any Award, agreement or purchase order, is revoked, canceled, suspended, or discontinued by operation of law or otherwise (“Registration Issue”), or if Carrier’s insurance policies are canceled, reduced or otherwise invalidated (“Insurance Issue”), Carrier shall promptly notify Niagara, and in no case later than forty-eight (48) hours after Carrier learns of any such Registration or Insurance Issue and Niagara shall have the right to terminate any Award, agreement or purchase order immediately and/ or collect reimbursement for all expenses it has incurred in preparation of and/ or as a result of any Award, agreement or purchase order from Carrier. Carrier’s notification to Niagara in regards to the above shall in no way serve as a waiver by Niagara of its right to construe such as a breach of any Award, agreement or purchase order and shall in no way limit Niagara’s right to pursue all remedies in law or equity as a result of such breach. d) If, in Niagara’s sole discretion, delays in transportation cause inconvenience and/or harm to Niagara’s business interests, or Carrier is otherwise in breach of any Award, agreement or purchase order, Niagara shall provide written notice to Carrier outlining the delay and resulting or anticipated harm and/or breach. If the deficiencies and/or breach remain following a period of thirty (30) days from the date written notice was provided, as is measured as of the date specified on the notice, Niagara may terminate any Award, agreement or purchase order upon thirty (30) days written notice to Carrier. e) In the event of any discontinuation and/or revision to any regulations and/or laws in the United States (or any other country where Carrier services Niagara), and/or if Niagara, in its sole discretion, determines that the services contemplated in any Award, agreement or purchase order are no longer necessary or required and/or that Niagara’s course of business strategy has changed, Niagara may terminate any Award, agreement or purchase order in part or in its entirety upon sixty (60) days’ notice to Carrier. f) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary herein, Niagara shall have the ability to terminate any Award, agreement or purchase order for convenience with a sixty (60) day written notice, and Carrier shall have the ability to terminate any Award or agreement with one hundred eighty (180) day written notice to Niagara.

Such written notice must be sent to Vice President of Legal Affairs via email and certified mail (1) panderson@niagarawater.com, (2) 2560 E. Philadelphia St., Ontario, CA 91761. g) Waiver. Niagara’s delay, failure or partial exercise of any provision herein or waiver of any breach, right or remedy contained in or granted by any Award, agreement or purchase order shall not be deemed a waiver of any breach, right or remedy unless expressly stated as such by Niagara in writing signed by an authorized representative of Niagara, and then such waiver shall be limited solely to its specific terms.
Limitation of Liability. In no event shall Niagara be liable for any punitive, exemplary, special, incidental, indirect or consequential damages of any kind (including, but not limited to loss of profits, loss of reputation, and/or loss of current or prospective business advantage, when where such losses are characterized as direct damages) arising out of or in any way related to the relationship and/or dealings between Niagara and Carrier regardless of whether the claim under which damages are sought is based upon contract, tort, negligence, strict liability or otherwise, and regardless of whether the parties have been advised of the possibility of such damages at the time of contracting or otherwise. Under no circumstances shall Niagara’s maximum total liability, if any, arising out of or in any way related to the relationship and/or dealings between Niagara and Carrier exceed the amounts paid and/or due to Carrier by Niagara under any relationship between the Parties, Award, agreement or purchase order.
Liability for Loss, Damage or Delay to Loads. a) Carrier agrees that in the transportation of all Loads hereunder, it shall assume, and does assume, the liability of an interstate motor carrier, as provided by 49 U.S.C. § 14706, with such liability to exist from the time of the receipt of any of said goods by Carrier until proper delivery has been made to the location specified by Niagara. The Parties expressly decline to limit the value of the property as permitted by 49 U.S.C. § 14706(c). All claims will be filed and resolved in accordance with the ICC regulations in 49 CFR Part 370. b) All Loads tendered to Carrier for transportation will be palletized and stretch wrapped. Carrier reserves the right to refuse to accept any Load that is not so packaged. c) Parties agree that each incident of transportation of product under any Award, agreement or purchase order shall be evidenced by a BOL signed by Carrier and Niagara showing the kind, quantity, value and condition of products or goods received and delivered by Carrier at the loading and unloading points respectively. Carrier’s duties and responsibilities under any Award, agreement or purchase order between the Parties for the transport of any Load evidenced by such receipt shall commence when Carrier takes possession and control of Niagara’s property or upon execution of such receipt by Niagara, whichever occurs first, and shall end when consignee/customer/buyer signs a delivery receipt and Carrier delivers Niagara’s property. Carrier shall inspect all Loads prior to accepting possession and control and shall document any evidence of damage on the BOL. If Carrier does not indicate damage on the BOL at the time of possession and immediately communicates the existence of such damage to Niagara, Carrier agrees that damage documented upon delivery presumptively occurred while the Load was in Carrier’s custody and possession. d) The time limit within which Niagara must file a claim for damaged or lost products or goods against Carrier shall be nine (9) months from the date of delivery or within nine (9) months of the reasonably anticipated date of delivery in the event of a complete loss. All claims shall be paid, settled or disallowed by Carrier within ninety (90) days of filing. Disallowance shall state a lawful reason for declining to accept responsibility for the claim, and shall be stated by Carrier, not its insurer. In no event shall Niagara be required to work with Carrier’s insurer directly. Niagara agrees to immediately provide written notice of claim to Carrier showing kind, quantity, value and proof of carriage as evidenced by a signed BOL. e) In the event of Carrier’s breach, or alleged breach, as determined solely by Niagara, of any provision in any Award, agreement or purchase order between the Parties, in addition to all other remedies in law or equity that are available to Niagara, Carrier shall be responsible for all reasonable attorneys’ fees and costs incurred by Niagara as a result of said breach or alleged breach.
Product Loss or Damage. a) Rejected Load. In the event the Niagara’s customer rejects the delivery of any Load due to the fault of Carrier, Carrier must return the Load to the pick-up origin designated by Niagara at no cost. In the event Niagara’s customer rejects the delivery of a Load due to no fault of the Carrier, Niagara shall pay a transportation rate equal to the rate Niagara paid Carrier to transport the Load to Niagara’s customer. Any and all rejected Loads not scheduled for redelivery must be delivered back to Niagara’s pick-up origin within five (5) days from the time/date of initial pick-up. Any Load being transported back to Niagara’s pick-up origin must be secured with either a seal or padlock and a confirmation must be sent via email to executionteam@niagarawater.com. Return charges for shorthaul clusters will be returned at half the published rate of the Load. For long haul cluster freight, return charges will not exceed the total all-in rate of the Load. b) Visual Damage to Products. 1) For damages to individual cases of product up to less than one pallet, Niagara’s customer must note the damage on the BOL, and customer or Carrier may dispose of or donate damaged cases of product. 2) For damage to one or more pallets, Niagara’s customer must note the damage on the BOL. If the Load is rejected and remains in the custody of Carrier, Carrier must immediately contact Niagara Dispatch for deposition instructions. Carrier must provide the purchase order number, date and time of single delivery, number of pallets damaged and/or refused, bottle code, any photographs, a brief description of the damage, and contact information, including contact name, phone number, email and facsimile number. c) Concealed Damage to Products. If Niagara’s customer reports concealed damage to the product, pallet and/or Load, such damage will be investigated to determine liability. If the investigation concludes that Carrier is responsible for the damage, Carrier will be notified of Niagara’s intent to file a claim and will be given the opportunity to inspect the product, pallet, or Load prior to disposition for disposal or donation. d) Product Loss/Delay. In the event Carrier is unable to execute delivery for reasons such as theft of Load, vehicular accident, or delay impacting the product’s integrity (i.e., non-delivery of Load/products to its specified destination within five (5) calendar days), recovery of loss will be executed pursuant to 49 CFR 370. e) Donation/Disposal. Due to product liability, trademark protection, and/or licensing agreements for private label stock, any distressed, damaged or otherwise rejected shipment that is not returned to a Niagara facility, for whatever reason, must be properly disposed of or donated in accordance with Niagara’s express written instruction. IN NO CIRCUMSTANCE CAN ANY GOODS, PRODUCTS OR INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY EVER BE RE-SOLD. Carrier understands and agrees that in no event shall Carrier nor any Carrier Actors, without the prior express written consent of Niagara: (i) cause, suffer or permit the transfer, salvage, disposal and/or donation of any Goods, Products or Intellectual Property, and/or (ii) offer to transfer, salvage, dispose of and/or donate any Goods, Products or Intellectual Property, whether as salvage or otherwise. Notwithstanding the foregoing, if there is a distressed, damaged or otherwise rejected Load of product that is not returned to a Niagara facility, and Niagara gives express written permission to a Carrier to dispose of or donate the goods or products, Niagara shall require written verification, signed by the Carrier’s authorized agent, which provides exact details as to the final disposition as well as copies of donation/disposal receipts as backup. f) Claim Settlement. In order to close a freight claim as settled, one of the following conclusions must be obtained: • Granted: paid in full • Declined: written declination including a specific legal reason • Compromised: written offer to settle for less than the original claim amount, including legal rationale for offer to pay less than full amount claimed g) Payment.

Philadelphia Street Ontario, CA 91761 Attention: Claims Specialist Niagara’s claim reference number must appear on the check. A partial payment check will not be accepted and will not be cashed as a granted or settled claim.
Seals. Carrier agrees to comply with the Food and Drug Administration and industry standards with regard to seals as codified in FDA 21 CFR 110.93, which states that all transportation of food shall be under conditions to protect that food. Storage and transportation of finished food shall be under conditions that will protect the food against physical, chemical, and microbial contamination as well as against deterioration of the food and the container, Carrier further agrees to use standard industry practices, including, but not limited to ensuring that any and all trailers from or on behalf of Niagara will be kept sealed while transporting all goods. Carrier must confirm that the seal has been secured on the trailer and that the seal number is recorded on the BOL by Niagara prior to leaving any of Niagara’s facilities. If the seal is required to be broken at any time during transport, Carrier must first seek Niagara’s authorization. Carrier must then notify Niagara that the trailer has been re-sealed by sending an e-mail to executionteam@niagarawater.com. In the event Niagara’s customer breaks the seal, rejects the Load, and does not provide Carrier with a new seal to re-seal the trailer, Niagara’s customer or Carrier must add a lock to the trailer to secure the Load. It is Carrier’s sole responsibility to ensure that the trailer is re-sealed or a lock is added to the trailer prior to leaving Niagara’s customer’s facilities. No Loads will be accepted by Niagara without a seal or lock on the trailer.
Insurance. During the term of all Awards, agreements or purchase orders, and after any termination of or expiration, and for as long as Carrier owes any obligation to Niagara and/or any statute of limitations for any potential claim that Niagara may have against Carrier remains unexpired, Carrier and any Carrier Actors shall maintain all insurance and/or bonds required by statute, law and any Award, agreement or purchase order with minimum insurance limits consistent with Niagara’s insurance requirements set forth at the end of this Section 16. Should insurance policy limits be exhausted or should Carrier or any Carrier Actors fail to maintain the required insurance coverage, neither Carrier nor any Carrier Actor will in any way be relieved from liability provided for herein to Niagara should a loss occur. Carrier shall furnish Niagara with a certificate evidencing the aforementioned coverage limits via email to insurancecerts@niagarawater.com. Such certificate shall provide for thirty (30) days written notice to Niagara in the event of cancellation. All certificates of insurance shall name Niagara Bottling, LLC and its parents, subsidiaries, employees, agents, affiliates and assigns as an additional insured by policy endorsement (on both Carrier’s General Liability Policy, Automobile Liability Policy and Cargo Insurance Policy) and waive all rights of subrogation against Niagara, its parent, director, officers, employees, stockholders, subsidiaries and affiliates with regard to Employee Liability and Workers Compensation. For any claims relating to an Agreement, agreement or purchase order, the Carrier’s insurance shall be deemed to be primary and not contributing to or in excess of any similar coverage purchased by Niagara. Carrier hereby acknowledges that naming Niagara Bottling, LLC and its parents, subsidiaries, employees, agents, affiliates and assigns as an additional insured by policy endorsement is a condition precedent to payment by Niagara. For the avoidance of doubt, Niagara will not be required to submit payment until the requirements of this provision have been met. However, failure of Niagara to demand any certificates or to identify any deficiency in the insurance provided shall not be construed as or deemed to be a waiver of the Carrier’s (or its agents or subcontractors) obligation to maintain such insurance. If any of the coverages are required to remain in force after termination of the Agreement, Carrier shall submit additional certificates evidencing continuation of coverage until such obligation ends. Niagara’s Minimum Insurance Requirements: Commercial General Liability $2,000,000 per occurrence; $5,000,000 aggregate Auto Liability $3,000,000 combined single limit Cargo $100,000 Employee Liability/Workman’s Comp $2,000,000/Statutory In addition to the general insurance requirements provided in the above table, customized insurance requirements for specific Seller-types are attached hereto and incorporated herein by this reference.

Additionally, if Carrier cannot provide the POD within fourteen (14) days of delivery, Niagara may charge Carrier for the cost of any of Niagara’s customer’s invoice for product not paid. Alternatively, if Niagara receives a refusal to pay for a Load from its customer, Niagara will provide Carrier of evidence of customer refusal and proof of loss, and shall charge Carrier the cost of customer’s invoice for product.
Assignment and Subcontracting. Carrier agrees not to interline, use other motor carriers or brokers, or to use “substituted services” or otherwise assign or subcontract any portion of any Award, agreement or purchase order without the express written consent of Niagara. If, with the express written permission of Niagara, Carrier elects to use a delivery agent or subcontract the transportation of a Load, Carrier shall be the sole bearer of any costs associated with the delivery agent or subcontractor and agrees to be fully liable for any loss, damage, or delay to transportation of any such Loads while in this third party carrier’s care, custody and/or control. Carrier understands and agrees that all payments made by Niagara are conditioned upon Niagara’s receipt of a conditional waiver and release executed by Carrier and an unconditional waiver and release executed by each Additional Party. Carrier agrees to defend, indemnify and hold Niagara and its customer’s harmless from any and all claims of any Additional Party for payment. Carrier acknowledges and agrees that Carrier shall remain, at all times, fully liable for all Additional Parties. Carrier warrants that it shall ensure that Additional Parties comply with and adhere to all warranties, representations, obligations, terms and conditions contained herein.

Indemnification: a) Carrier agrees to indemnify, defend, and hold Niagara, its affiliates, and representatives harmless from and against any and all claims arising out of or related to any Award, agreement, or purchase order and/or Transportation Services that are the subject thereof, including but not limited to: (i) any bodily injury or property damage claims, and any liability, loss, cost, expense, or other damages (including reasonable attorney fees) brought about by any injury of any kind suffered by any person or property as a result of any act, neglect, default, omission of either the Carrier, Carrier’s agents, employees, affiliates, subcontractors, or any third party for whose actions Carrier is responsible (“Carrier Actors”), or Niagara, Niagara’s agents, employees, affiliates, subcontractors or other representatives; (ii) any negligent act, misfeasance, or nonfeasance by Carrier, or Carrier Actors; (iii) any harm, injury, damage, or loss arising out of or in connection with the Transportation Services provided; (iv) third party consumer claims, suits, and/or demands, including costs and expenses of investigation and settlement and attorneys’ fees and expenses, to the extent such claims arise from: (a) any act or omission by Carrier or Carrier Actors relating to or affecting the condition, quality, or character of any Goods or Services provided; or (b) trademark, copyright, trade dress, or patent infringement. Carrier acknowledges and agrees that Carrier must receive Niagara’s express written approval prior to settling any claim or lawsuit. Niagara reserves the right at any time to control its own defense. b) Should Carrier receive (or become aware of) any demand, service of process, notice, action, settlement, summons, complaint or the like from or by a third party alleging that a Party hereto is responsible for some injury, act, omission, breach, negligence, claim, loss, violation of law, settlement, cost, expense, obligation, liability, damage, recovery, deficiency or otherwise, including, without limitation, interest, penalties, reasonable attorney fees and costs (each, a “Claim”) that arises out of, results from, or in any way relates to the subject matter of these Standard Terms and Conditions, an Award, agreement or purchase order, then Carrier shall immediately (but no later than five (5) business days after receipt, or becoming aware, of a third party Claim) provide Niagara with written notice regarding each third party Claim of which Carrier is or becomes aware. Carrier covenants and agrees that should Carrier fail to provide Niagara with timely written notice regarding any third party Claim, Carrier hereby generally and expressly waives, relinquishes and releases, and agrees to hold harmless, Niagara from and against any and all Claims capable of being asserted by Carrier against Niagara in connection therewith. c) In the event Carrier utilizes any party (“Additional Party”) regardless of that party’s legal designation of contractor, subcontractor, materials supplier, agent, or otherwise, for the purpose of performing any Transportation Services, Carrier shall submit to Niagara written notice of (i) each Additional Party, (ii) the duties each Additional Party will undertake, (iii) the amount of compensation each Additional Party is to receive from Carrier, and (iv) Carrier’s compensation schedule and payment terms with the Additional Party. Carrier understands submitting this written notice as set forth above is a condition precedent to payment. Such written notice must be sent to Vice President of Legal Affairs via email and certified mail (1) panderson@niagarawater.com, (2) 2560 E. Philadelphia St., Ontario, CA 91761. g) Waiver. Niagara’s delay, failure or partial exercise of any provision herein or waiver of any breach, right or remedy contained in or granted by any Award, agreement or purchase order shall not be deemed a waiver of any breach, right or remedy unless expressly stated as such by Niagara in writing signed by an authorized representative of Niagara, and then such waiver shall be limited solely to its specific terms.
Limitation of Liability. In no event shall Niagara be liable for any punitive, exemplary, special, incidental, indirect or consequential damages of any kind (including, but not limited to loss of profits, loss of reputation, and/or loss of current or prospective business advantage, when where such losses are characterized as direct damages) arising out of or in any way related to the relationship and/or dealings between Niagara and Carrier regardless of whether the claim under which damages are sought is based upon contract, tort, negligence, strict liability or otherwise, and regardless of whether the parties have been advised of the possibility of such damages at the time of contracting or otherwise. Under no circumstances shall Niagara’s maximum total liability, if any, arising out of or in any way related to the relationship and/or dealings between Niagara and Carrier exceed the amounts paid and/or due to Carrier by Niagara under any relationship between the Parties, Award, agreement or purchase order.
Liability for Loss, Damage or Delay to Loads. a) Carrier agrees that in the transportation of all Loads hereunder, it shall assume, and does assume, the liability of an interstate motor carrier, as provided by 49 U.S.C. § 14706, with such liability to exist from the time of the receipt of any of said goods by Carrier until proper delivery has been made to the location specified by Niagara. The Parties expressly decline to limit the value of the property as permitted by 49 U.S.C. § 14706(c). All claims will be filed and resolved in accordance with the ICC regulations in 49 CFR Part 370. b) All Loads tendered to Carrier for transportation will be palletized and stretch wrapped. Carrier reserves the right to refuse to accept any Load that is not so packaged. c) Parties agree that each incident of transportation of product under any Award, agreement or purchase order shall be evidenced by a BOL signed by Carrier and Niagara showing the kind, quantity, value and condition of products or goods received and delivered by Carrier at the loading and unloading points respectively. Carrier’s duties and responsibilities under any Award, agreement or purchase order between the Parties for the transport of any Load evidenced by such receipt shall commence when Carrier takes possession and control of Niagara’s property or upon execution of such receipt by Niagara, whichever occurs first, and shall end when consignee/customer/buyer signs a delivery receipt and Carrier delivers Niagara’s property. Carrier shall inspect all Loads prior to accepting possession and control and shall document any evidence of damage on the BOL. If Carrier does not indicate damage on the BOL at the time of possession and immediately communicates the existence of such damage to Niagara, Carrier agrees that damage documented upon delivery presumptively occurred while the Load was in Carrier’s custody and possession. d) The time limit within which Niagara must file a claim for damaged or lost products or goods against Carrier shall be nine (9) months from the date of delivery or within nine (9) months of the reasonably anticipated date of delivery in the event of a complete loss. All claims shall be paid, settled or disallowed by Carrier within ninety (90) days of filing. Disallowance shall state a lawful reason for declining to accept responsibility for the claim, and shall be stated by Carrier, not its insurer. In no event shall Niagara be required to work with Carrier’s insurer directly. Niagara agrees to immediately provide written notice of claim to Carrier showing kind, quantity, value and proof of carriage as evidenced by a signed BOL. e) In the event of Carrier’s breach, or alleged breach, as determined solely by Niagara, of any provision in any Award, agreement or purchase order between the Parties, in addition to all other remedies in law or equity that are available to Niagara, Carrier shall be responsible for all reasonable attorneys’ fees and costs incurred by Niagara as a result of said breach or alleged breach.
Product Loss or Damage. a) Rejected Load. In the event the Niagara’s customer rejects the delivery of any Load due to the fault of Carrier, Carrier must return the Load to the pick-up origin designated by Niagara at no cost. In the event Niagara’s customer rejects the delivery of a Load due to no fault of the Carrier, Niagara shall pay a transportation rate equal to the rate Niagara paid Carrier to transport the Load to Niagara’s customer. Any and all rejected Loads not scheduled for redelivery must be delivered back to Niagara’s pick-up origin within five (5) days from the time/date of initial pick-up. Any Load being transported back to Niagara’s pick-up origin must be secured with either a seal or padlock and a confirmation must be sent via email to executionteam@niagarawater.com. Return charges for shorthaul clusters will be returned at half the published rate of the Load. For long haul cluster freight, return charges will not exceed the total all-in rate of the Load. b) Visual Damage to Products. 1) For damages to individual cases of product up to less than one pallet, Niagara’s customer must note the damage on the BOL, and customer or Carrier may dispose of or donate damaged cases of product. 2) For damage to one or more pallets, Niagara’s customer must note the damage on the BOL. If the Load is rejected and remains in the custody of Carrier, Carrier must immediately contact Niagara Dispatch for deposition instructions. Carrier must provide the purchase order number, date and time of single delivery, number of pallets damaged and/or refused, bottle code, any photographs, a brief description of the damage, and contact information, including contact name, phone number, email and facsimile number. c) Concealed Damage to Products. If Niagara’s customer reports concealed damage to the product, pallet and/or Load, such damage will be investigated to determine liability. If the investigation concludes that Carrier is responsible for the damage, Carrier will be notified of Niagara’s intent to file a claim and will be given the opportunity to inspect the product, pallet, or Load prior to disposition for disposal or donation. d) Product Loss/Delay. In the event Carrier is unable to execute delivery for reasons such as theft of Load, vehicular accident, or delay impacting the product’s integrity (i.e., non-delivery of Load/products to its specified destination within five (5) calendar days), recovery of loss will be executed pursuant to 49 CFR 370. e) Donation/Disposal. Due to product liability, trademark protection, and/or licensing agreements for private label stock, any distressed, damaged or otherwise rejected shipment that is not returned to a Niagara facility, for whatever reason, must be properly disposed of or donated in accordance with Niagara’s express written instruction. IN NO CIRCUMSTANCE CAN ANY GOODS, PRODUCTS OR INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY EVER BE RE-SOLD. Carrier understands and agrees that in no event shall Carrier nor any Carrier Actors, without the prior express written consent of Niagara: (i) cause, suffer or permit the transfer, salvage, disposal and/or donation of any Goods, Products or Intellectual Property, and/or (ii) offer to transfer, salvage, dispose of and/or donate any Goods, Products or Intellectual Property, whether as salvage or otherwise. Notwithstanding the foregoing, if there is a distressed, damaged or otherwise rejected Load of product that is not returned to a Niagara facility, and Niagara gives express written permission to a Carrier to dispose of or donate the goods or products, Niagara shall require written verification, signed by the Carrier’s authorized agent, which provides exact details as to the final disposition as well as copies of donation/disposal receipts as backup. f) Claim Settlement. In order to close a freight claim as settled, one of the following conclusions must be obtained: • Granted: paid in full • Declined: written declination including a specific legal reason • Compromised: written offer to settle for less than the original claim amount, including legal rationale for offer to pay less than full amount claimed g) Payment. Any and all payments from Carrier to Niagara in settlement of a claim must be made, in full, and sent to: Niagara Bottling, LLC 2560 E. Philadelphia Street Ontario, CA 91761 Attention: Claims Specialist Niagara’s claim reference number must appear on the check. A partial payment check will not be accepted and will not be cashed as a granted or settled claim.
Seals. Carrier agrees to comply with the Food and Drug Administration and industry standards with regard to seals as codified in FDA 21 CFR 110.93, which states that all transportation of food shall be under conditions to protect that food. Storage and transportation of finished food shall be under conditions that will protect the food against physical, chemical, and microbial contamination as well as against deterioration of the food and the container, Carrier further agrees to use standard industry practices, including, but not limited to ensuring that any and all trailers from or on behalf of Niagara will be kept sealed while transporting all goods. Carrier must confirm that the seal has been secured on the trailer and that the seal number is recorded on the BOL by Niagara prior to leaving any of Niagara’s facilities. If the seal is required to be broken at any time during transport, Carrier must first seek Niagara’s authorization. Carrier must then notify Niagara that the trailer has been re-sealed by sending an e-mail to executionteam@niagarawater.com. In the event Niagara’s customer breaks the seal, rejects the Load, and does not provide Carrier with a new seal to re-seal the trailer, Niagara’s customer or Carrier must add a lock to the trailer to secure the Load. It is Carrier’s sole responsibility to ensure that the trailer is re-sealed or a lock is added to the trailer prior to leaving Niagara’s customer’s facilities. No Loads will be accepted by Niagara without a seal or lock on the trailer.
Insurance. During the term of all Awards, agreements or purchase orders, and after any termination of or expiration, and for as long as Carrier owes any obligation to Niagara and/or any statute of limitations for any potential claim that Niagara may have against Carrier remains unexpired, Carrier and any Carrier Actors shall maintain all insurance and/or bonds required by statute, law and any Award, agreement or purchase order with minimum insurance limits consistent with Niagara’s insurance requirements set forth at the end of this Section 16. Should insurance policy limits be exhausted or should Carrier or any Carrier Actors fail to maintain the required insurance coverage, neither Carrier nor any Carrier Actor will in any way be relieved from liability provided for herein to Niagara should a loss occur. Carrier shall furnish Niagara with a certificate evidencing the aforementioned coverage limits via email to insurancecerts@niagarawater.com. Such certificate shall provide for thirty (30) days written notice to Niagara in the event of cancellation. All certificates of insurance shall name Niagara Bottling, LLC and its parents, subsidiaries, employees, agents, affiliates and assigns as an additional insured by policy endorsement (on both Carrier’s General Liability Policy, Automobile Liability Policy and Cargo Insurance Policy) and waive all rights of subrogation against Niagara, its parent, director, officers, employees, stockholders, subsidiaries and affiliates with regard to Employee Liability and Workers Compensation. For any claims relating to an Agreement, agreement or purchase order, the Carrier’s insurance shall be deemed to be primary and not contributing to or in excess of any similar coverage purchased by Niagara. Carrier hereby acknowledges that naming Niagara Bottling, LLC and its parents, subsidiaries, employees, agents, affiliates and assigns as an additional insured by policy endorsement is a condition precedent to payment by Niagara. For the avoidance of doubt, Niagara will not be required to submit payment until the requirements of this provision have been met. However, failure of Niagara to demand any certificates or to identify any deficiency in the insurance provided shall not be construed as or deemed to be a waiver of the Carrier’s (or its agents or subcontractors) obligation to maintain such insurance. If any of the coverages are required to remain in force after termination of the Agreement, Carrier shall submit additional certificates evidencing continuation of coverage until such obligation ends. Niagara’s Minimum Insurance Requirements: Commercial General Liability $2,000,000 per occurrence; $5,000,000 aggregate Auto Liability $3,000,000 combined single limit Cargo $100,000 Employee Liability/Workman’s Comp $2,000,000/Statutory In addition to the general insurance requirements provided in the above table, customized insurance requirements for specific Seller-types are attached hereto and incorporated herein by this reference.
Termination. a) Any Award, agreement or purchase order shall commence on the date such Award is given, agreement is entered into or purchase order is issued, and shall automatically renew on a year-to-year basis until terminated, provided that Carrier is performing in accordance with these Carrier Standard T&C’s, the Award, agreement or purchase order, and that Carrier continues to provide Niagara the lowest available rates in the market and the lowest rates and/or most favorable terms at which Carrier offers its service to any third party shipper in the same functional level of the trade as Niagara (“Most Favorable Rates”). The Parties agree to meet in good faith to discuss existing rates at a time no earlier than twelve (12) months after the Award is issued or an agreement is entered into by the Parties. Such discussions may result in a rate adjustment if, and only if, the adjustment is in reference to driver pay, and only upon mutual written consent by both Parties. Notwithstanding the foregoing, Carrier guarantees that any rate increase will not exceed 2% of the current rate. In the event that Carrier does not provide Niagara with the Most Favorable Rates, Niagara shall have the right to terminate by giving thirty (30) days written notice to Carrier. b) If during the term specified by any Award, agreement, or purchase order either party (i) files a petition in bankruptcy or has a petition in bankruptcy filed against it that is not dismissed within sixty (60) days, or (ii) makes a general assignment for the benefit of creditors, then in any such case the non-bankrupt party may terminate any Award, agreement or purchase order by giving written notice of such effect to the bankrupt party. c) If all or any portion of Carrier’s registration, as required by any Award, agreement or purchase order, is revoked, canceled, suspended, or discontinued by operation of law or otherwise (“Registration Issue”), or if Carrier’s insurance policies are canceled, reduced or otherwise invalidated (“Insurance Issue”), Carrier shall promptly notify Niagara, and in no case later than forty-eight (48) hours after Carrier learns of any such Registration or Insurance Issue and Niagara shall have the right to terminate any Award, agreement or purchase order immediately and/ or collect reimbursement for all expenses it has incurred in preparation of and/ or as a result of any Award, agreement or purchase order from Carrier. Carrier’s notification to Niagara in regards to the above shall in no way serve as a waiver by Niagara of its right to construe such as a breach of any Award, agreement or purchase order and shall in no way limit Niagara’s right to pursue all remedies in law or equity as a result of such breach. d) If, in Niagara’s sole discretion, delays in transportation cause inconvenience and/or harm to Niagara’s business interests, or Carrier is otherwise in breach of any Award, agreement or purchase order, Niagara shall provide written notice to Carrier outlining the delay and resulting or anticipated harm and/or breach. If the deficiencies and/or breach remain following a period of thirty (30) days from the date written notice was provided, as is measured as of the date specified on the notice, Niagara may terminate any Award, agreement or purchase order upon thirty (30) days written notice to Carrier. e) In the event of any discontinuation and/or revision to any regulations and/or laws in the United States (or any other country where Carrier services Niagara), and/or if Niagara, in its sole discretion, determines that the services contemplated in any Award, agreement or purchase order are no longer necessary or required and/or that Niagara’s course of business strategy has changed, Niagara may terminate any Award, agreement or purchase order in part or in its entirety upon sixty (60) days’ notice to Carrier. f) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary herein, Niagara shall have the ability to terminate any Award, agreement or purchase order for convenience with a sixty (60) day written notice, and Carrier shall have the ability to terminate any Award or agreement with one hundred eighty (180) day written notice to Niagara.

Should Niagara provide an Award to Carrier for additional Lanes and/or Loads to provide Transportation Services to, such additional Award will be subject to these Standard Carrier T&C’s.
Payment Terms. Prior to commencement of Transportation Services, and in order to receive payment from Niagara, Carrier must provide Niagara with a Certificate of Insurance (COI) in accordance with Section 16 herein. Carrier shall only invoice Niagara for awarded Lanes and/or Loads received from Niagara.

Carrier shall maintain a 98% monthly rate for on-time delivery of Loads through the entire term of the Award. On-time delivery of Loads shall mean Loads delivered within thirty (30) minutes of a scheduled delivery appointment time.

Niagara may scale and weigh all Loads and shall provide a pallet count for all Loads. In accepting any Load, Carrier agrees to count all pallet quantities prior to sealing the trailer.

In the event Carrier is unable to haul Niagara’s scale and weighted Load, causing Niagara to remove any products or pallets, Carrier agrees that Niagara may deduct a fee of $100 per occurrence from Carrier’s corresponding purchase order. d) Equipment. Carrier shall ensure that all equipment used in connection with performing Transporting Services be clean, odor-free, dry, leak-proof, and free of contamination and/or infestation. Carrier warrants that no motor vehicle, trailer, tractor or other equipment that will be used for Transportation Services for Niagara has been used to transport refuse, garbage, trash or solid or liquid waste of any kind, or any types of hazardous materials.

Alternatively, if Niagara receives a refusal to pay for a Load from its customer, Niagara will provide Carrier of evidence of customer refusal and proof of loss, and shall charge Carrier the cost of customer’s invoice for product.
Assignment and Subcontracting. Carrier agrees not to interline, use other motor carriers or brokers, or to use “substituted services” or otherwise assign or subcontract any portion of any Award, agreement or purchase order without the express written consent of Niagara. If, with the express written permission of Niagara, Carrier elects to use a delivery agent or subcontract the transportation of a Load, Carrier shall be the sole bearer of any costs associated with the delivery agent or subcontractor and agrees to be fully liable for any loss, damage, or delay to transportation of any such Loads while in this third party carrier’s care, custody and/or control. Carrier understands and agrees that all payments made by Niagara are conditioned upon Niagara’s receipt of a conditional waiver and release executed by Carrier and an unconditional waiver and release executed by each Additional Party. Carrier agrees to defend, indemnify and hold Niagara and its customer’s harmless from any and all claims of any Additional Party for payment. Carrier acknowledges and agrees that Carrier shall remain, at all times, fully liable for all Additional Parties. Carrier warrants that it shall ensure that Additional Parties comply with and adhere to all warranties, representations, obligations, terms and conditions contained herein.

Indemnification: a) Carrier agrees to indemnify, defend, and hold Niagara, its affiliates, and representatives harmless from and against any and all claims arising out of or related to any Award, agreement, or purchase order and/or Transportation Services that are the subject thereof, including but not limited to: (i) any bodily injury or property damage claims, and any liability, loss, cost, expense, or other damages (including reasonable attorney fees) brought about by any injury of any kind suffered by any person or property as a result of any act, neglect, default, omission of either the Carrier, Carrier’s agents, employees, affiliates, subcontractors, or any third party for whose actions Carrier is responsible (“Carrier Actors”), or Niagara, Niagara’s agents, employees, affiliates, subcontractors or other representatives; (ii) any negligent act, misfeasance, or nonfeasance by Carrier, or Carrier Actors; (iii) any harm, injury, damage, or loss arising out of or in connection with the Transportation Services provided; (iv) third party consumer claims, suits, and/or demands, including costs and expenses of investigation and settlement and attorneys’ fees and expenses, to the extent such claims arise from: (a) any act or omission by Carrier or Carrier Actors relating to or affecting the condition, quality, or character of any Goods or Services provided; or (b) trademark, copyright, trade dress, or patent infringement. Carrier acknowledges and agrees that Carrier must receive Niagara’s express written approval prior to settling any claim or lawsuit. Niagara reserves the right at any time to control its own defense. b) Should Carrier receive (or become aware of) any demand, service of process, notice, action, settlement, summons, complaint or the like from or by a third party alleging that a Party hereto is responsible for some injury, act, omission, breach, negligence, claim, loss, violation of law, settlement, cost, expense, obligation, liability, damage, recovery, deficiency or otherwise, including, without limitation, interest, penalties, reasonable attorney fees and costs (each, a “Claim”) that arises out of, results from, or in any way relates to the subject matter of these Standard Terms and Conditions, an Award, agreement or purchase order, then Carrier shall immediately (but no later than five (5) business days after receipt, or becoming aware, of a third party Claim) provide Niagara with written notice regarding each third party Claim of which Carrier is or becomes aware.

Such written notice must be sent to Vice President of Legal Affairs via email and certified mail (1) panderson@niagarawater.com, (2) 2560 E. Philadelphia St., Ontario, CA 91761. g) Waiver. Niagara’s delay, failure or partial exercise of any provision herein or waiver of any breach, right or remedy contained in or granted by any Award, agreement or purchase order shall not be deemed a waiver of any breach, right or remedy unless expressly stated as such by Niagara in writing signed by an authorized representative of Niagara, and then such waiver shall be limited solely to its specific terms.
Limitation of Liability. In no event shall Niagara be liable for any punitive, exemplary, special, incidental, indirect or consequential damages of any kind (including, but not limited to loss of profits, loss of reputation, and/or loss of current or prospective business advantage, when where such losses are characterized as direct damages) arising out of or in any way related to the relationship and/or dealings between Niagara and Carrier regardless of whether the claim under which damages are sought is based upon contract, tort, negligence, strict liability or otherwise, and regardless of whether the parties have been advised of the possibility of such damages at the time of contracting or otherwise. Under no circumstances shall Niagara’s maximum total liability, if any, arising out of or in any way related to the relationship and/or dealings between Niagara and Carrier exceed the amounts paid and/or due to Carrier by Niagara under any relationship between the Parties, Award, agreement or purchase order.
Liability for Loss, Damage or Delay to Loads. a) Carrier agrees that in the transportation of all Loads hereunder, it shall assume, and does assume, the liability of an interstate motor carrier, as provided by 49 U.S.C. § 14706, with such liability to exist from the time of the receipt of any of said goods by Carrier until proper delivery has been made to the location specified by Niagara. The Parties expressly decline to limit the value of the property as permitted by 49 U.S.C. § 14706(c). All claims will be filed and resolved in accordance with the ICC regulations in 49 CFR Part 370. b) All Loads tendered to Carrier for transportation will be palletized and stretch wrapped. Carrier reserves the right to refuse to accept any Load that is not so packaged. c) Parties agree that each incident of transportation of product under any Award, agreement or purchase order shall be evidenced by a BOL signed by Carrier and Niagara showing the kind, quantity, value and condition of products or goods received and delivered by Carrier at the loading and unloading points respectively. Carrier’s duties and responsibilities under any Award, agreement or purchase order between the Parties for the transport of any Load evidenced by such receipt shall commence when Carrier takes possession and control of Niagara’s property or upon execution of such receipt by Niagara, whichever occurs first, and shall end when consignee/customer/buyer signs a delivery receipt and Carrier delivers Niagara’s property. Carrier shall inspect all Loads prior to accepting possession and control and shall document any evidence of damage on the BOL. If Carrier does not indicate damage on the BOL at the time of possession and immediately communicates the existence of such damage to Niagara, Carrier agrees that damage documented upon delivery presumptively occurred while the Load was in Carrier’s custody and possession. d) The time limit within which Niagara must file a claim for damaged or lost products or goods against Carrier shall be nine (9) months from the date of delivery or within nine (9) months of the reasonably anticipated date of delivery in the event of a complete loss. All claims shall be paid, settled or disallowed by Carrier within ninety (90) days of filing. Disallowance shall state a lawful reason for declining to accept responsibility for the claim, and shall be stated by Carrier, not its insurer. In no event shall Niagara be required to work with Carrier’s insurer directly. Niagara agrees to immediately provide written notice of claim to Carrier showing kind, quantity, value and proof of carriage as evidenced by a signed BOL. e) In the event of Carrier’s breach, or alleged breach, as determined solely by Niagara, of any provision in any Award, agreement or purchase order between the Parties, in addition to all other remedies in law or equity that are available to Niagara, Carrier shall be responsible for all reasonable attorneys’ fees and costs incurred by Niagara as a result of said breach or alleged breach.
Product Loss or Damage. a) Rejected Load. In the event the Niagara’s customer rejects the delivery of any Load due to the fault of Carrier, Carrier must return the Load to the pick-up origin designated by Niagara at no cost. In the event Niagara’s customer rejects the delivery of a Load due to no fault of the Carrier, Niagara shall pay a transportation rate equal to the rate Niagara paid Carrier to transport the Load to Niagara’s customer. Any and all rejected Loads not scheduled for redelivery must be delivered back to Niagara’s pick-up origin within five (5) days from the time/date of initial pick-up. Any Load being transported back to Niagara’s pick-up origin must be secured with either a seal or padlock and a confirmation must be sent via email to executionteam@niagarawater.com. Return charges for shorthaul clusters will be returned at half the published rate of the Load. For long haul cluster freight, return charges will not exceed the total all-in rate of the Load. b) Visual Damage to Products. 1) For damages to individual cases of product up to less than one pallet, Niagara’s customer must note the damage on the BOL, and customer or Carrier may dispose of or donate damaged cases of product. 2) For damage to one or more pallets, Niagara’s customer must note the damage on the BOL. If the Load is rejected and remains in the custody of Carrier, Carrier must immediately contact Niagara Dispatch for deposition instructions. Carrier must provide the purchase order number, date and time of single delivery, number of pallets damaged and/or refused, bottle code, any photographs, a brief description of the damage, and contact information, including contact name, phone number, email and facsimile number. c) Concealed Damage to Products. If Niagara’s customer reports concealed damage to the product, pallet and/or Load, such damage will be investigated to determine liability. If the investigation concludes that Carrier is responsible for the damage, Carrier will be notified of Niagara’s intent to file a claim and will be given the opportunity to inspect the product, pallet, or Load prior to disposition for disposal or donation. d) Product Loss/Delay. In the event Carrier is unable to execute delivery for reasons such as theft of Load, vehicular accident, or delay impacting the product’s integrity (i.e., non-delivery of Load/products to its specified destination within five (5) calendar days), recovery of loss will be executed pursuant to 49 CFR 370. e) Donation/Disposal. Due to product liability, trademark protection, and/or licensing agreements for private label stock, any distressed, damaged or otherwise rejected shipment that is not returned to a Niagara facility, for whatever reason, must be properly disposed of or donated in accordance with Niagara’s express written instruction. IN NO CIRCUMSTANCE CAN ANY GOODS, PRODUCTS OR INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY EVER BE RE-SOLD. Carrier understands and agrees that in no event shall Carrier nor any Carrier Actors, without the prior express written consent of Niagara: (i) cause, suffer or permit the transfer, salvage, disposal and/or donation of any Goods, Products or Intellectual Property, and/or (ii) offer to transfer, salvage, dispose of and/or donate any Goods, Products or Intellectual Property, whether as salvage or otherwise. Notwithstanding the foregoing, if there is a distressed, damaged or otherwise rejected Load of product that is not returned to a Niagara facility, and Niagara gives express written permission to a Carrier to dispose of or donate the goods or products, Niagara shall require written verification, signed by the Carrier’s authorized agent, which provides exact details as to the final disposition as well as copies of donation/disposal receipts as backup. f) Claim Settlement. In order to close a freight claim as settled, one of the following conclusions must be obtained: • Granted: paid in full • Declined: written declination including a specific legal reason • Compromised: written offer to settle for less than the original claim amount, including legal rationale for offer to pay less than full amount claimed g) Payment. Any and all payments from Carrier to Niagara in settlement of a claim must be made, in full, and sent to: Niagara Bottling, LLC 2560 E. Philadelphia Street Ontario, CA 91761 Attention: Claims Specialist Niagara’s claim reference number must appear on the check. A partial payment check will not be accepted and will not be cashed as a granted or settled claim.
Seals. Carrier agrees to comply with the Food and Drug Administration and industry standards with regard to seals as codified in FDA 21 CFR 110.93, which states that all transportation of food shall be under conditions to protect that food. Storage and transportation of finished food shall be under conditions that will protect the food against physical, chemical, and microbial contamination as well as against deterioration of the food and the container, Carrier further agrees to use standard industry practices, including, but not limited to ensuring that any and all trailers from or on behalf of Niagara will be kept sealed while transporting all goods. Carrier must confirm that the seal has been secured on the trailer and that the seal number is recorded on the BOL by Niagara prior to leaving any of Niagara’s facilities. If the seal is required to be broken at any time during transport, Carrier must first seek Niagara’s authorization. Carrier must then notify Niagara that the trailer has been re-sealed by sending an e-mail to executionteam@niagarawater.com. In the event Niagara’s customer breaks the seal, rejects the Load, and does not provide Carrier with a new seal to re-seal the trailer, Niagara’s customer or Carrier must add a lock to the trailer to secure the Load. It is Carrier’s sole responsibility to ensure that the trailer is re-sealed or a lock is added to the trailer prior to leaving Niagara’s customer’s facilities. No Loads will be accepted by Niagara without a seal or lock on the trailer.
Insurance. During the term of all Awards, agreements or purchase orders, and after any termination of or expiration, and for as long as Carrier owes any obligation to Niagara and/or any statute of limitations for any potential claim that Niagara may have against Carrier remains unexpired, Carrier and any Carrier Actors shall maintain all insurance and/or bonds required by statute, law and any Award, agreement or purchase order with minimum insurance limits consistent with Niagara’s insurance requirements set forth at the end of this Section 16. Should insurance policy limits be exhausted or should Carrier or any Carrier Actors fail to maintain the required insurance coverage, neither Carrier nor any Carrier Actor will in any way be relieved from liability provided for herein to Niagara should a loss occur. Carrier shall furnish Niagara with a certificate evidencing the aforementioned coverage limits via email to insurancecerts@niagarawater.com. Such certificate shall provide for thirty (30) days written notice to Niagara in the event of cancellation. All certificates of insurance shall name Niagara Bottling, LLC and its parents, subsidiaries, employees, agents, affiliates and assigns as an additional insured by policy endorsement (on both Carrier’s General Liability Policy, Automobile Liability Policy and Cargo Insurance Policy) and waive all rights of subrogation against Niagara, its parent, director, officers, employees, stockholders, subsidiaries and affiliates with regard to Employee Liability and Workers Compensation. For any claims relating to an Agreement, agreement or purchase order, the Carrier’s insurance shall be deemed to be primary and not contributing to or in excess of any similar coverage purchased by Niagara. Carrier hereby acknowledges that naming Niagara Bottling, LLC and its parents, subsidiaries, employees, agents, affiliates and assigns as an additional insured by policy endorsement is a condition precedent to payment by Niagara. For the avoidance of doubt, Niagara will not be required to submit payment until the requirements of this provision have been met. However, failure of Niagara to demand any certificates or to identify any deficiency in the insurance provided shall not be construed as or deemed to be a waiver of the Carrier’s (or its agents or subcontractors) obligation to maintain such insurance. If any of the coverages are required to remain in force after termination of the Agreement, Carrier shall submit additional certificates evidencing continuation of coverage until such obligation ends. Niagara’s Minimum Insurance Requirements: Commercial General Liability $2,000,000 per occurrence; $5,000,000 aggregate Auto Liability $3,000,000 combined single limit Cargo $100,000 Employee Liability/Workman’s Comp $2,000,000/Statutory In addition to the general insurance requirements provided in the above table, customized insurance requirements for specific Seller-types are attached hereto and incorporated herein by this reference.
Termination. a) Any Award, agreement or purchase order shall commence on the date such Award is given, agreement is entered into or purchase order is issued, and shall automatically renew on a year-to-year basis until terminated, provided that Carrier is performing in accordance with these Carrier Standard T&C’s, the Award, agreement or purchase order, and that Carrier continues to provide Niagara the lowest available rates in the market and the lowest rates and/or most favorable terms at which Carrier offers its service to any third party shipper in the same functional level of the trade as Niagara (“Most Favorable Rates”). The Parties agree to meet in good faith to discuss existing rates at a time no earlier than twelve (12) months after the Award is issued or an agreement is entered into by the Parties. Such discussions may result in a rate adjustment if, and only if, the adjustment is in reference to driver pay, and only upon mutual written consent by both Parties. Notwithstanding the foregoing, Carrier guarantees that any rate increase will not exceed 2% of the current rate. In the event that Carrier does not provide Niagara with the Most Favorable Rates, Niagara shall have the right to terminate by giving thirty (30) days written notice to Carrier. b) If during the term specified by any Award, agreement, or purchase order either party (i) files a petition in bankruptcy or has a petition in bankruptcy filed against it that is not dismissed within sixty (60) days, or (ii) makes a general assignment for the benefit of creditors, then in any such case the non-bankrupt party may terminate any Award, agreement or purchase order by giving written notice of such effect to the bankrupt party. c) If all or any portion of Carrier’s registration, as required by any Award, agreement or purchase order, is revoked, canceled, suspended, or discontinued by operation of law or otherwise (“Registration Issue”), or if Carrier’s insurance policies are canceled, reduced or otherwise invalidated (“Insurance Issue”), Carrier shall promptly notify Niagara, and in no case later than forty-eight (48) hours after Carrier learns of any such Registration or Insurance Issue and Niagara shall have the right to terminate any Award, agreement or purchase order immediately and/ or collect reimbursement for all expenses it has incurred in preparation of and/ or as a result of any Award, agreement or purchase order from Carrier. Carrier’s notification to Niagara in regards to the above shall in no way serve as a waiver by Niagara of its right to construe such as a breach of any Award, agreement or purchase order and shall in no way limit Niagara’s right to pursue all remedies in law or equity as a result of such breach. d) If, in Niagara’s sole discretion, delays in transportation cause inconvenience and/or harm to Niagara’s business interests, or Carrier is otherwise in breach of any Award, agreement or purchase order, Niagara shall provide written notice to Carrier outlining the delay and resulting or anticipated harm and/or breach. If the deficiencies and/or breach remain following a period of thirty (30) days from the date written notice was provided, as is measured as of the date specified on the notice, Niagara may terminate any Award, agreement or purchase order upon thirty (30) days written notice to Carrier. e) In the event of any discontinuation and/or revision to any regulations and/or laws in the United States (or any other country where Carrier services Niagara), and/or if Niagara, in its sole discretion, determines that the services contemplated in any Award, agreement or purchase order are no longer necessary or required and/or that Niagara’s course of business strategy has changed, Niagara may terminate any Award, agreement or purchase order in part or in its entirety upon sixty (60) days’ notice to Carrier. f) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary herein, Niagara shall have the ability to terminate any Award, agreement or purchase order for convenience with a sixty (60) day written notice, and Carrier shall have the ability to terminate any Award or agreement with one hundred eighty (180) day written notice to Niagara.

Should Niagara provide an Award to Carrier for additional Lanes and/or Loads to provide Transportation Services to, such additional Award will be subject to these Standard Carrier T&C’s.
Payment Terms. Prior to commencement of Transportation Services, and in order to receive payment from Niagara, Carrier must provide Niagara with a Certificate of Insurance (COI) in accordance with Section 16 herein. Carrier shall only invoice Niagara for awarded Lanes and/or Loads received from Niagara. Such invoice and all supporting documents shall be submitted promptly, following transport of any Load to Niagara via email at truckingbackup@niagarawater.com. Such invoices must include Carrier’s name and invoice number in the subject line. Each email shall only include one (1) invoice per email submission.

Niagara shall have no liability for invoices that are not received within ninety (90) days of transport of any Load. Niagara shall have no liability for added, balance due, accessorial or any other charges of any nature which are not provided by the Award and which are not submitted within ninety (90) days from date of transport of a Load.

Carrier shall maintain a 98% monthly rate for on-time delivery of Loads through the entire term of the Award. On-time delivery of Loads shall mean Loads delivered within thirty (30) minutes of a scheduled delivery appointment time.

Niagara may scale and weigh all Loads and shall provide a pallet count for all Loads. In accepting any Load, Carrier agrees to count all pallet quantities prior to sealing the trailer.

Assignment and Subcontracting. Carrier agrees not to interline, use other motor carriers or brokers, or to use “substituted services” or otherwise assign or subcontract any portion of any Award, agreement or purchase order without the express written consent of Niagara. If, with the express written permission of Niagara, Carrier elects to use a delivery agent or subcontract the transportation of a Load, Carrier shall be the sole bearer of any costs associated with the delivery agent or subcontractor and agrees to be fully liable for any loss, damage, or delay to transportation of any such Loads while in this third party carrier’s care, custody and/or control.

Niagara’s delay, failure or partial exercise of any provision herein or waiver of any breach, right or remedy contained in or granted by any Award, agreement or purchase order shall not be deemed a waiver of any breach, right or remedy unless expressly stated as such by Niagara in writing signed by an authorized representative of Niagara, and then such waiver shall be limited solely to its specific terms.
Limitation of Liability. In no event shall Niagara be liable for any punitive, exemplary, special, incidental, indirect or consequential damages of any kind (including, but not limited to loss of profits, loss of reputation, and/or loss of current or prospective business advantage, when where such losses are characterized as direct damages) arising out of or in any way related to the relationship and/or dealings between Niagara and Carrier regardless of whether the claim under which damages are sought is based upon contract, tort, negligence, strict liability or otherwise, and regardless of whether the parties have been advised of the possibility of such damages at the time of contracting or otherwise. Under no circumstances shall Niagara’s maximum total liability, if any, arising out of or in any way related to the relationship and/or dealings between Niagara and Carrier exceed the amounts paid and/or due to Carrier by Niagara under any relationship between the Parties, Award, agreement or purchase order.
Liability for Loss, Damage or Delay to Loads. a) Carrier agrees that in the transportation of all Loads hereunder, it shall assume, and does assume, the liability of an interstate motor carrier, as provided by 49 U.S.C. § 14706, with such liability to exist from the time of the receipt of any of said goods by Carrier until proper delivery has been made to the location specified by Niagara. The Parties expressly decline to limit the value of the property as permitted by 49 U.S.C. § 14706(c). All claims will be filed and resolved in accordance with the ICC regulations in 49 CFR Part 370. b) All Loads tendered to Carrier for transportation will be palletized and stretch wrapped. Carrier reserves the right to refuse to accept any Load that is not so packaged. c) Parties agree that each incident of transportation of product under any Award, agreement or purchase order shall be evidenced by a BOL signed by Carrier and Niagara showing the kind, quantity, value and condition of products or goods received and delivered by Carrier at the loading and unloading points respectively. Carrier’s duties and responsibilities under any Award, agreement or purchase order between the Parties for the transport of any Load evidenced by such receipt shall commence when Carrier takes possession and control of Niagara’s property or upon execution of such receipt by Niagara, whichever occurs first, and shall end when consignee/customer/buyer signs a delivery receipt and Carrier delivers Niagara’s property. Carrier shall inspect all Loads prior to accepting possession and control and shall document any evidence of damage on the BOL. If Carrier does not indicate damage on the BOL at the time of possession and immediately communicates the existence of such damage to Niagara, Carrier agrees that damage documented upon delivery presumptively occurred while the Load was in Carrier’s custody and possession. d) The time limit within which Niagara must file a claim for damaged or lost products or goods against Carrier shall be nine (9) months from the date of delivery or within nine (9) months of the reasonably anticipated date of delivery in the event of a complete loss. All claims shall be paid, settled or disallowed by Carrier within ninety (90) days of filing. Disallowance shall state a lawful reason for declining to accept responsibility for the claim, and shall be stated by Carrier, not its insurer. In no event shall Niagara be required to work with Carrier’s insurer directly. Niagara agrees to immediately provide written notice of claim to Carrier showing kind, quantity, value and proof of carriage as evidenced by a signed BOL. e) In the event of Carrier’s breach, or alleged breach, as determined solely by Niagara, of any provision in any Award, agreement or purchase order between the Parties, in addition to all other remedies in law or equity that are available to Niagara, Carrier shall be responsible for all reasonable attorneys’ fees and costs incurred by Niagara as a result of said breach or alleged breach.
Product Loss or Damage. a) Rejected Load. In the event the Niagara’s customer rejects the delivery of any Load due to the fault of Carrier, Carrier must return the Load to the pick-up origin designated by Niagara at no cost. In the event Niagara’s customer rejects the delivery of a Load due to no fault of the Carrier, Niagara shall pay a transportation rate equal to the rate Niagara paid Carrier to transport the Load to Niagara’s customer. Any and all rejected Loads not scheduled for redelivery must be delivered back to Niagara’s pick-up origin within five (5) days from the time/date of initial pick-up. Any Load being transported back to Niagara’s pick-up origin must be secured with either a seal or padlock and a confirmation must be sent via email to executionteam@niagarawater.com. Return charges for shorthaul clusters will be returned at half the published rate of the Load. For long haul cluster freight, return charges will not exceed the total all-in rate of the Load. b) Visual Damage to Products. 1) For damages to individual cases of product up to less than one pallet, Niagara’s customer must note the damage on the BOL, and customer or Carrier may dispose of or donate damaged cases of product. 2) For damage to one or more pallets, Niagara’s customer must note the damage on the BOL. If the Load is rejected and remains in the custody of Carrier, Carrier must immediately contact Niagara Dispatch for deposition instructions. Carrier must provide the purchase order number, date and time of single delivery, number of pallets damaged and/or refused, bottle code, any photographs, a brief description of the damage, and contact information, including contact name, phone number, email and facsimile number. c) Concealed Damage to Products. If Niagara’s customer reports concealed damage to the product, pallet and/or Load, such damage will be investigated to determine liability. If the investigation concludes that Carrier is responsible for the damage, Carrier will be notified of Niagara’s intent to file a claim and will be given the opportunity to inspect the product, pallet, or Load prior to disposition for disposal or donation. d) Product Loss/Delay. In the event Carrier is unable to execute delivery for reasons such as theft of Load, vehicular accident, or delay impacting the product’s integrity (i.e., non-delivery of Load/products to its specified destination within five (5) calendar days), recovery of loss will be executed pursuant to 49 CFR 370. e) Donation/Disposal. Due to product liability, trademark protection, and/or licensing agreements for private label stock, any distressed, damaged or otherwise rejected shipment that is not returned to a Niagara facility, for whatever reason, must be properly disposed of or donated in accordance with Niagara’s express written instruction. IN NO CIRCUMSTANCE CAN ANY GOODS, PRODUCTS OR INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY EVER BE RE-SOLD. Carrier understands and agrees that in no event shall Carrier nor any Carrier Actors, without the prior express written consent of Niagara: (i) cause, suffer or permit the transfer, salvage, disposal and/or donation of any Goods, Products or Intellectual Property, and/or (ii) offer to transfer, salvage, dispose of and/or donate any Goods, Products or Intellectual Property, whether as salvage or otherwise. Notwithstanding the foregoing, if there is a distressed, damaged or otherwise rejected Load of product that is not returned to a Niagara facility, and Niagara gives express written permission to a Carrier to dispose of or donate the goods or products, Niagara shall require written verification, signed by the Carrier’s authorized agent, which provides exact details as to the final disposition as well as copies of donation/disposal receipts as backup. f) Claim Settlement. In order to close a freight claim as settled, one of the following conclusions must be obtained: • Granted: paid in full • Declined: written declination including a specific legal reason • Compromised: written offer to settle for less than the original claim amount, including legal rationale for offer to pay less than full amount claimed g) Payment.

Philadelphia Street Ontario, CA 91761 Attention: Claims Specialist Niagara’s claim reference number must appear on the check. A partial payment check will not be accepted and will not be cashed as a granted or settled claim.
Seals. Carrier agrees to comply with the Food and Drug Administration and industry standards with regard to seals as codified in FDA 21 CFR 110.93, which states that all transportation of food shall be under conditions to protect that food. Storage and transportation of finished food shall be under conditions that will protect the food against physical, chemical, and microbial contamination as well as against deterioration of the food and the container, Carrier further agrees to use standard industry practices, including, but not limited to ensuring that any and all trailers from or on behalf of Niagara will be kept sealed while transporting all goods. Carrier must confirm that the seal has been secured on the trailer and that the seal number is recorded on the BOL by Niagara prior to leaving any of Niagara’s facilities. If the seal is required to be broken at any time during transport, Carrier must first seek Niagara’s authorization. Carrier must then notify Niagara that the trailer has been re-sealed by sending an e-mail to executionteam@niagarawater.com. In the event Niagara’s customer breaks the seal, rejects the Load, and does not provide Carrier with a new seal to re-seal the trailer, Niagara’s customer or Carrier must add a lock to the trailer to secure the Load. It is Carrier’s sole responsibility to ensure that the trailer is re-sealed or a lock is added to the trailer prior to leaving Niagara’s customer’s facilities. No Loads will be accepted by Niagara without a seal or lock on the trailer.
Insurance. During the term of all Awards, agreements or purchase orders, and after any termination of or expiration, and for as long as Carrier owes any obligation to Niagara and/or any statute of limitations for any potential claim that Niagara may have against Carrier remains unexpired, Carrier and any Carrier Actors shall maintain all insurance and/or bonds required by statute, law and any Award, agreement or purchase order with minimum insurance limits consistent with Niagara’s insurance requirements set forth at the end of this Section 16. Should insurance policy limits be exhausted or should Carrier or any Carrier Actors fail to maintain the required insurance coverage, neither Carrier nor any Carrier Actor will in any way be relieved from liability provided for herein to Niagara should a loss occur. Carrier shall furnish Niagara with a certificate evidencing the aforementioned coverage limits via email to insurancecerts@niagarawater.com. Such certificate shall provide for thirty (30) days written notice to Niagara in the event of cancellation. All certificates of insurance shall name Niagara Bottling, LLC and its parents, subsidiaries, employees, agents, affiliates and assigns as an additional insured by policy endorsement (on both Carrier’s General Liability Policy, Automobile Liability Policy and Cargo Insurance Policy) and waive all rights of subrogation against Niagara, its parent, director, officers, employees, stockholders, subsidiaries and affiliates with regard to Employee Liability and Workers Compensation. For any claims relating to an Agreement, agreement or purchase order, the Carrier’s insurance shall be deemed to be primary and not contributing to or in excess of any similar coverage purchased by Niagara. Carrier hereby acknowledges that naming Niagara Bottling, LLC and its parents, subsidiaries, employees, agents, affiliates and assigns as an additional insured by policy endorsement is a condition precedent to payment by Niagara. For the avoidance of doubt, Niagara will not be required to submit payment until the requirements of this provision have been met. However, failure of Niagara to demand any certificates or to identify any deficiency in the insurance provided shall not be construed as or deemed to be a waiver of the Carrier’s (or its agents or subcontractors) obligation to maintain such insurance. If any of the coverages are required to remain in force after termination of the Agreement, Carrier shall submit additional certificates evidencing continuation of coverage until such obligation ends. Niagara’s Minimum Insurance Requirements: Commercial General Liability $2,000,000 per occurrence; $5,000,000 aggregate Auto Liability $3,000,000 combined single limit Cargo $100,000 Employee Liability/Workman’s Comp $2,000,000/Statutory In addition to the general insurance requirements provided in the above table, customized insurance requirements for specific Seller-types are attached hereto and incorporated herein by this reference.

Niagara reserves the right at any time to control its own defense. b) Should Carrier receive (or become aware of) any demand, service of process, notice, action, settlement, summons, complaint or the like from or by a third party alleging that a Party hereto is responsible for some injury, act, omission, breach, negligence, claim, loss, violation of law, settlement, cost, expense, obligation, liability, damage, recovery, deficiency or otherwise, including, without limitation, interest, penalties, reasonable attorney fees and costs (each, a “Claim”) that arises out of, results from, or in any way relates to the subject matter of these Standard Terms and Conditions, an Award, agreement or purchase order, then Carrier shall immediately (but no later than five (5) business days after receipt, or becoming aware, of a third party Claim) provide Niagara with written notice regarding each third party Claim of which Carrier is or becomes aware.

Carrier understands submitting this written notice as set forth above is a condition precedent to payment. Such written notice must be sent to Vice President of Legal Affairs via email and certified mail (1) panderson@niagarawater.com, (2) 2560 E. Philadelphia St., Ontario, CA 91761. g) Waiver. Niagara’s delay, failure or partial exercise of any provision herein or waiver of any breach, right or remedy contained in or granted by any Award, agreement or purchase order shall not be deemed a waiver of any breach, right or remedy unless expressly stated as such by Niagara in writing signed by an authorized representative of Niagara, and then such waiver shall be limited solely to its specific terms.
Limitation of Liability. In no event shall Niagara be liable for any punitive, exemplary, special, incidental, indirect or consequential damages of any kind (including, but not limited to loss of profits, loss of reputation, and/or loss of current or prospective business advantage, when where such losses are characterized as direct damages) arising out of or in any way related to the relationship and/or dealings between Niagara and Carrier regardless of whether the claim under which damages are sought is based upon contract, tort, negligence, strict liability or otherwise, and regardless of whether the parties have been advised of the possibility of such damages at the time of contracting or otherwise. Under no circumstances shall Niagara’s maximum total liability, if any, arising out of or in any way related to the relationship and/or dealings between Niagara and Carrier exceed the amounts paid and/or due to Carrier by Niagara under any relationship between the Parties, Award, agreement or purchase order.
Liability for Loss, Damage or Delay to Loads. a) Carrier agrees that in the transportation of all Loads hereunder, it shall assume, and does assume, the liability of an interstate motor carrier, as provided by 49 U.S.C. § 14706, with such liability to exist from the time of the receipt of any of said goods by Carrier until proper delivery has been made to the location specified by Niagara. The Parties expressly decline to limit the value of the property as permitted by 49 U.S.C. § 14706(c). All claims will be filed and resolved in accordance with the ICC regulations in 49 CFR Part 370. b) All Loads tendered to Carrier for transportation will be palletized and stretch wrapped. Carrier reserves the right to refuse to accept any Load that is not so packaged. c) Parties agree that each incident of transportation of product under any Award, agreement or purchase order shall be evidenced by a BOL signed by Carrier and Niagara showing the kind, quantity, value and condition of products or goods received and delivered by Carrier at the loading and unloading points respectively. Carrier’s duties and responsibilities under any Award, agreement or purchase order between the Parties for the transport of any Load evidenced by such receipt shall commence when Carrier takes possession and control of Niagara’s property or upon execution of such receipt by Niagara, whichever occurs first, and shall end when consignee/customer/buyer signs a delivery receipt and Carrier delivers Niagara’s property. Carrier shall inspect all Loads prior to accepting possession and control and shall document any evidence of damage on the BOL. If Carrier does not indicate damage on the BOL at the time of possession and immediately communicates the existence of such damage to Niagara, Carrier agrees that damage documented upon delivery presumptively occurred while the Load was in Carrier’s custody and possession. d) The time limit within which Niagara must file a claim for damaged or lost products or goods against Carrier shall be nine (9) months from the date of delivery or within nine (9) months of the reasonably anticipated date of delivery in the event of a complete loss. All claims shall be paid, settled or disallowed by Carrier within ninety (90) days of filing. Disallowance shall state a lawful reason for declining to accept responsibility for the claim, and shall be stated by Carrier, not its insurer. In no event shall Niagara be required to work with Carrier’s insurer directly. Niagara agrees to immediately provide written notice of claim to Carrier showing kind, quantity, value and proof of carriage as evidenced by a signed BOL. e) In the event of Carrier’s breach, or alleged breach, as determined solely by Niagara, of any provision in any Award, agreement or purchase order between the Parties, in addition to all other remedies in law or equity that are available to Niagara, Carrier shall be responsible for all reasonable attorneys’ fees and costs incurred by Niagara as a result of said breach or alleged breach.
Product Loss or Damage. a) Rejected Load. In the event the Niagara’s customer rejects the delivery of any Load due to the fault of Carrier, Carrier must return the Load to the pick-up origin designated by Niagara at no cost. In the event Niagara’s customer rejects the delivery of a Load due to no fault of the Carrier, Niagara shall pay a transportation rate equal to the rate Niagara paid Carrier to transport the Load to Niagara’s customer. Any and all rejected Loads not scheduled for redelivery must be delivered back to Niagara’s pick-up origin within five (5) days from the time/date of initial pick-up. Any Load being transported back to Niagara’s pick-up origin must be secured with either a seal or padlock and a confirmation must be sent via email to executionteam@niagarawater.com. Return charges for shorthaul clusters will be returned at half the published rate of the Load. For long haul cluster freight, return charges will not exceed the total all-in rate of the Load. b) Visual Damage to Products. 1) For damages to individual cases of product up to less than one pallet, Niagara’s customer must note the damage on the BOL, and customer or Carrier may dispose of or donate damaged cases of product. 2) For damage to one or more pallets, Niagara’s customer must note the damage on the BOL. If the Load is rejected and remains in the custody of Carrier, Carrier must immediately contact Niagara Dispatch for deposition instructions. Carrier must provide the purchase order number, date and time of single delivery, number of pallets damaged and/or refused, bottle code, any photographs, a brief description of the damage, and contact information, including contact name, phone number, email and facsimile number. c) Concealed Damage to Products. If Niagara’s customer reports concealed damage to the product, pallet and/or Load, such damage will be investigated to determine liability. If the investigation concludes that Carrier is responsible for the damage, Carrier will be notified of Niagara’s intent to file a claim and will be given the opportunity to inspect the product, pallet, or Load prior to disposition for disposal or donation. d) Product Loss/Delay. In the event Carrier is unable to execute delivery for reasons such as theft of Load, vehicular accident, or delay impacting the product’s integrity (i.e., non-delivery of Load/products to its specified destination within five (5) calendar days), recovery of loss will be executed pursuant to 49 CFR 370. e) Donation/Disposal. Due to product liability, trademark protection, and/or licensing agreements for private label stock, any distressed, damaged or otherwise rejected shipment that is not returned to a Niagara facility, for whatever reason, must be properly disposed of or donated in accordance with Niagara’s express written instruction. IN NO CIRCUMSTANCE CAN ANY GOODS, PRODUCTS OR INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY EVER BE RE-SOLD. Carrier understands and agrees that in no event shall Carrier nor any Carrier Actors, without the prior express written consent of Niagara: (i) cause, suffer or permit the transfer, salvage, disposal and/or donation of any Goods, Products or Intellectual Property, and/or (ii) offer to transfer, salvage, dispose of and/or donate any Goods, Products or Intellectual Property, whether as salvage or otherwise. Notwithstanding the foregoing, if there is a distressed, damaged or otherwise rejected Load of product that is not returned to a Niagara facility, and Niagara gives express written permission to a Carrier to dispose of or donate the goods or products, Niagara shall require written verification, signed by the Carrier’s authorized agent, which provides exact details as to the final disposition as well as copies of donation/disposal receipts as backup. f) Claim Settlement. In order to close a freight claim as settled, one of the following conclusions must be obtained: • Granted: paid in full • Declined: written declination including a specific legal reason • Compromised: written offer to settle for less than the original claim amount, including legal rationale for offer to pay less than full amount claimed g) Payment. Any and all payments from Carrier to Niagara in settlement of a claim must be made, in full, and sent to: Niagara Bottling, LLC 2560 E. Philadelphia Street Ontario, CA 91761 Attention: Claims Specialist Niagara’s claim reference number must appear on the check. A partial payment check will not be accepted and will not be cashed as a granted or settled claim.
Seals. Carrier agrees to comply with the Food and Drug Administration and industry standards with regard to seals as codified in FDA 21 CFR 110.93, which states that all transportation of food shall be under conditions to protect that food. Storage and transportation of finished food shall be under conditions that will protect the food against physical, chemical, and microbial contamination as well as against deterioration of the food and the container, Carrier further agrees to use standard industry practices, including, but not limited to ensuring that any and all trailers from or on behalf of Niagara will be kept sealed while transporting all goods. Carrier must confirm that the seal has been secured on the trailer and that the seal number is recorded on the BOL by Niagara prior to leaving any of Niagara’s facilities. If the seal is required to be broken at any time during transport, Carrier must first seek Niagara’s authorization. Carrier must then notify Niagara that the trailer has been re-sealed by sending an e-mail to executionteam@niagarawater.com. In the event Niagara’s customer breaks the seal, rejects the Load, and does not provide Carrier with a new seal to re-seal the trailer, Niagara’s customer or Carrier must add a lock to the trailer to secure the Load. It is Carrier’s sole responsibility to ensure that the trailer is re-sealed or a lock is added to the trailer prior to leaving Niagara’s customer’s facilities. No Loads will be accepted by Niagara without a seal or lock on the trailer.
Insurance. During the term of all Awards, agreements or purchase orders, and after any termination of or expiration, and for as long as Carrier owes any obligation to Niagara and/or any statute of limitations for any potential claim that Niagara may have against Carrier remains unexpired, Carrier and any Carrier Actors shall maintain all insurance and/or bonds required by statute, law and any Award, agreement or purchase order with minimum insurance limits consistent with Niagara’s insurance requirements set forth at the end of this Section 16. Should insurance policy limits be exhausted or should Carrier or any Carrier Actors fail to maintain the required insurance coverage, neither Carrier nor any Carrier Actor will in any way be relieved from liability provided for herein to Niagara should a loss occur. Carrier shall furnish Niagara with a certificate evidencing the aforementioned coverage limits via email to insurancecerts@niagarawater.com. Such certificate shall provide for thirty (30) days written notice to Niagara in the event of cancellation. All certificates of insurance shall name Niagara Bottling, LLC and its parents, subsidiaries, employees, agents, affiliates and assigns as an additional insured by policy endorsement (on both Carrier’s General Liability Policy, Automobile Liability Policy and Cargo Insurance Policy) and waive all rights of subrogation against Niagara, its parent, director, officers, employees, stockholders, subsidiaries and affiliates with regard to Employee Liability and Workers Compensation. For any claims relating to an Agreement, agreement or purchase order, the Carrier’s insurance shall be deemed to be primary and not contributing to or in excess of any similar coverage purchased by Niagara. Carrier hereby acknowledges that naming Niagara Bottling, LLC and its parents, subsidiaries, employees, agents, affiliates and assigns as an additional insured by policy endorsement is a condition precedent to payment by Niagara. For the avoidance of doubt, Niagara will not be required to submit payment until the requirements of this provision have been met. However, failure of Niagara to demand any certificates or to identify any deficiency in the insurance provided shall not be construed as or deemed to be a waiver of the Carrier’s (or its agents or subcontractors) obligation to maintain such insurance. If any of the coverages are required to remain in force after termination of the Agreement, Carrier shall submit additional certificates evidencing continuation of coverage until such obligation ends. Niagara’s Minimum Insurance Requirements: Commercial General Liability $2,000,000 per occurrence; $5,000,000 aggregate Auto Liability $3,000,000 combined single limit Cargo $100,000 Employee Liability/Workman’s Comp $2,000,000/Statutory In addition to the general insurance requirements provided in the above table, customized insurance requirements for specific Seller-types are attached hereto and incorporated herein by this reference.
Termination. a) Any Award, agreement or purchase order shall commence on the date such Award is given, agreement is entered into or purchase order is issued, and shall automatically renew on a year-to-year basis until terminated, provided that Carrier is performing in accordance with these Carrier Standard T&C’s, the Award, agreement or purchase order, and that Carrier continues to provide Niagara the lowest available rates in the market and the lowest rates and/or most favorable terms at which Carrier offers its service to any third party shipper in the same functional level of the trade as Niagara (“Most Favorable Rates”). The Parties agree to meet in good faith to discuss existing rates at a time no earlier than twelve (12) months after the Award is issued or an agreement is entered into by the Parties. Such discussions may result in a rate adjustment if, and only if, the adjustment is in reference to driver pay, and only upon mutual written consent by both Parties. Notwithstanding the foregoing, Carrier guarantees that any rate increase will not exceed 2% of the current rate. In the event that Carrier does not provide Niagara with the Most Favorable Rates, Niagara shall have the right to terminate by giving thirty (30) days written notice to Carrier. b) If during the term specified by any Award, agreement, or purchase order either party (i) files a petition in bankruptcy or has a petition in bankruptcy filed against it that is not dismissed within sixty (60) days, or (ii) makes a general assignment for the benefit of creditors, then in any such case the non-bankrupt party may terminate any Award, agreement or purchase order by giving written notice of such effect to the bankrupt party. c) If all or any portion of Carrier’s registration, as required by any Award, agreement or purchase order, is revoked, canceled, suspended, or discontinued by operation of law or otherwise (“Registration Issue”), or if Carrier’s insurance policies are canceled, reduced or otherwise invalidated (“Insurance Issue”), Carrier shall promptly notify Niagara, and in no case later than forty-eight (48) hours after Carrier learns of any such Registration or Insurance Issue and Niagara shall have the right to terminate any Award, agreement or purchase order immediately and/ or collect reimbursement for all expenses it has incurred in preparation of and/ or as a result of any Award, agreement or purchase order from Carrier. Carrier’s notification to Niagara in regards to the above shall in no way serve as a waiver by Niagara of its right to construe such as a breach of any Award, agreement or purchase order and shall in no way limit Niagara’s right to pursue all remedies in law or equity as a result of such breach. d) If, in Niagara’s sole discretion, delays in transportation cause inconvenience and/or harm to Niagara’s business interests, or Carrier is otherwise in breach of any Award, agreement or purchase order, Niagara shall provide written notice to Carrier outlining the delay and resulting or anticipated harm and/or breach. If the deficiencies and/or breach remain following a period of thirty (30) days from the date written notice was provided, as is measured as of the date specified on the notice, Niagara may terminate any Award, agreement or purchase order upon thirty (30) days written notice to Carrier. e) In the event of any discontinuation and/or revision to any regulations and/or laws in the United States (or any other country where Carrier services Niagara), and/or if Niagara, in its sole discretion, determines that the services contemplated in any Award, agreement or purchase order are no longer necessary or required and/or that Niagara’s course of business strategy has changed, Niagara may terminate any Award, agreement or purchase order in part or in its entirety upon sixty (60) days’ notice to Carrier. f) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary herein, Niagara shall have the ability to terminate any Award, agreement or purchase order for convenience with a sixty (60) day written notice, and Carrier shall have the ability to terminate any Award or agreement with one hundred eighty (180) day written notice to Niagara.

Source: Lightcast Impact Analysis Modeling –  September 2023
Who We Are
Niagara Bottling has been family-owned and operated since 1963. Headquartered in Diamond Bar, California, Niagara operates bottling facilities throughout the U.S. and Mexico. As a leading beverage manufacturer in the U.S., Niagara Bottling works closely with some of the largest beverage brands, retailers, grocers, and club and convenience stores throughout the country. Niagara produces a variety of beverages including bottled water, sparkling, vitamin and flavored water, teas, sports drinks, ready-to-drink coffee, protein drinks, and non-dairy milk products.
Our Commitment to Community
At Niagara, we are committed to making a positive impact on society and our communities. As part of this commitment, our local teams place an emphasis on supporting areas of education, emergency needs, community beautification, environment, and health and wellness. We are proud to partner with community leaders and charitable organizations that are making a meaningful difference in the world and in the areas where our facilities are located.
Drummers & Donations
Team Members from our Dallas plants donated water to the Crowley High School Band. The water was given to their drumline and color guard students when they went to competitions for their winter and spring season, and was also used at their two-day camp for next year’s marching season. Our team loves lending a hand to schools in their community.
Blue Thumb Silver Award
Our Dallas teams received a Blue Thumb Silver Award from the City of Dallas for maintaining water compliance for five consecutive years since 2016.

Our Focus on Sustainability
Niagara is committed to responsible resource usage and integrating sustainability into every aspect of our business. Niagara not only supports environmental initiatives, but innovation and leadership in their product, packaging, manufacturing, while promoting consumer awareness and action on sustainability issues. Here’s how Niagara is prioritizing sustainability:
Water Stewardship:
A standard Niagara facility uses less water to produce its products than it takes to keep a few golf courses green. Niagara typically pays volumetric fees for the water it uses and millions in taxes and fees to municipal systems that enable them to maintain and improve their infrastructure.
Packaging Efficiency
: Niagara uses less plastic for its bottles than its competitors, and innovations such as lightweight shrink film and corrugate-free nested packs create reductions in CO
2
across our product lifecycle.
Minimizing Environmental Impact:
Niagara PET bottles have a lower environmental impact across most impact categories when compared to other common beverage and water packaging types. Our half liter bottles have an embodied carbon footprint that is substantially below the U.S. average.
Recycling Infrastructure and Education
: Niagara supports recycling education through International Bottled Water Association’s “Put it in the Bin” campaign.

Our Focus on Sustainability
Niagara is committed to responsible resource usage and integrating sustainability into every aspect of our business. Niagara not only supports environmental initiatives, but innovation and leadership in their product, packaging, manufacturing, while promoting consumer awareness and action on sustainability issues. Here’s how Niagara is prioritizing sustainability:
Water Stewardship:
A A standard Niagara facility uses less water to produce its products than it takes to keep a few golf courses green. Niagara typically pays volumetric fees for the water we use and millions in taxes and fees to municipal systems that enable them to maintain and improve infrastructure
Packaging Efficiency
: Niagara uses less plastic for its bottles than its competitors, and innovations such as lightweight shrink film and corrugate-free nested packs create reductions in CO
2
across our product lifecycle.
Minimizing Environmental Impact:
Niagara PET bottles have a lower environmental impact across most impact categories when compared to other common beverage and water packaging types. Our half liter bottles have an embodied carbon footprint that is substantially below the U.S. average.
Recycling Infrastructure and Education
: Niagara supports recycling education through International Bottled Water Association’s “Put it in the Bin” campaign.

Our Focus on Sustainability
Niagara is committed to responsible resource usage and integrating sustainability into every aspect of our business. Niagara not only supports environmental initiatives, but innovation and leadership in their product, packaging, manufacturing, while promoting consumer awareness and action on sustainability issues. Here’s how Niagara is prioritizing sustainability:
Water Stewardship:
A standard Niagara facility uses less water to produce its products than it takes to keep three golf courses green. Niagara pays volumetric fees for the water it uses and millions in taxes and fees to municipal systems that enable them to maintain and improve their infrastructure.
Packaging Efficiency
: Niagara leads the industry with the lightest bottles and film used for packaging, significantly reducing plastic use, and further optimizes packaging by eliminating unnecessary corrugate components.
Lowest Environmental Impact:
Niagara PET water bottles have the lowest environmental impact across most impact categories when compared to other common beverage and water packaging types.
Recycling Infrastructure and Education
: Niagara supports The Recycling Partnership, which has rolled out 1.7 million recycling carts and the International Bottled Water Association’s “Put it in the Bin” recycling education campaign.

Should Niagara provide an Award to Carrier for additional Lanes and/or Loads to provide Transportation Services to, such additional Award will be subject to these Standard Carrier T&C’s.
Payment Terms. Prior to commencement of Transportation Services, and in order to receive payment from Niagara, Carrier must provide Niagara with a Certificate of Insurance (COI) in accordance with Section 16 herein. Carrier shall only invoice Niagara for awarded Lanes and/or Loads received from Niagara. Such invoice and all supporting documents shall be submitted promptly, following transport of any Load to Niagara via email at truckingbackup@niagarawater.com. Such invoices must include Carrier’s name and invoice number in the subject line. Each email shall only include one (1) invoice per email submission. Failure to comply with the terms of this section shall result in delay and/or non-payment of charges. Niagara will pay any undisputed portion of Carrier’s properly submitted invoice within thirty (30) days of receipt of invoice and supporting documentation. Any and all payments by Niagara shall be deemed effective as of the date of postmark. Niagara shall have no liability for invoices that are not received within ninety (90) days of transport of any Load. Niagara shall have no liability for added, balance due, accessorial or any other charges of any nature which are not provided by the Award and which are not submitted within ninety (90) days from date of transport of a Load. Carrier agrees to apply payment to the amount due for the specified invoice regardless of whether there are earlier unpaid invoices. In the event any payment becomes overdue, Carrier shall provide written notice to nonpayment via certified mail to: Attn: Vice President of Legal Affairs, Niagara Bottling, LLC, 2560 E. Philadelphia Street, Ontario, California 91761. Carrier shall also notify Niagara by sending emails to the following: Debra Morrison at dmorrison@niagarawater.com and transprocurement@niagarawater.com. Upon actual receipt of certified mail notice, Niagara shall have ten (10) days to cure any late payment. At no time during this cure period will Niagara be deemed in breach.

Should Niagara subsequently offer tenders for Loads not included in the Award or agreement and Carrier agrees to transport such Loads, Carrier agrees to transport such Load at the same rates as the delivery of Loads in the Award unless otherwise agreed to in writing by the Parties. Carrier must notify Niagara within ninety (90) minutes of receipt of Niagara’s tender offer that Carrier has: (a) received the tender offer; and (b) confirm that it will transport the Load.
Carrier Performance. Carrier understands that all Transportation Services must be performed in a timely fashion. Carrier is solely responsible for scheduling and complying with any and all deliveries and delivery times as requested by Niagara’s customers. a) Pick-up of Loads. Carrier shall maintain a monthly on-time pick up appoint rate of a minimum of 90% from the designated Niagara facility through the entire term of the Award. If Carrier’s monthly pick-up rate falls below 90%, Carrier agrees to a $50 fee for every late pick-up appointment for the previous month that caused Carrier to fall below the 90% pick-up rate. b) Delivery of Loads. Carrier shall maintain a 98% monthly rate for on-time delivery of Loads through the entire term of the Award. On-time delivery of Loads shall mean Loads delivered within thirty (30) minutes of a scheduled delivery appointment time. If Carrier’s monthly on-time delivery rate to Niagara or its customer’s locations falls below 98%, Carrier agrees to a $100 fee for every late and/or missed delivery appointment for the previous month that caused Carrier to fall below the 98% delivery rate. c) Payload: Carrier warrants that it has the ability to ship Loads that are 45,600 pounds or less. Niagara may scale and weigh all Loads and shall provide a pallet count for all Loads. In accepting any Load, Carrier agrees to count all pallet quantities prior to sealing the trailer. Niagara will make its best effort to produce a tactical forecast of the projected volume of Loads and weights for the upcoming month. In the event Niagara requests Carrier to haul 20% more of its projected daily volume, Carrier shall comply with such a request. In the event Carrier is unable to haul Niagara’s scale and weighted Load, causing Niagara to remove any products or pallets, Carrier agrees that Niagara may deduct a fee of $100 per occurrence from Carrier’s corresponding purchase order. d) Equipment. Carrier shall ensure that all equipment used in connection with performing Transporting Services be clean, odor-free, dry, leak-proof, and free of contamination and/or infestation. Carrier warrants that no motor vehicle, trailer, tractor or other equipment that will be used for Transportation Services for Niagara has been used to transport refuse, garbage, trash or solid or liquid waste of any kind, or any types of hazardous materials.

Carrier, at its sole expense, must maintain and make available a telephone line for customer service to Niagara. Such customer service line will be operational twenty-four hours a day, seven days a week, and shall respond within thirty (30) minutes of contact by Niagara.
Documentation. With respect to the following documents, Carrier agrees to maintain the documents as follows: a) Daily reports: Carrier shall provide Niagara daily reports regarding the status of all Loads and delivery times; b) Proof of Delivery (POD): Carrier shall provide Niagara free of charge with any and all PODs within 48-hours of delivery of any Load, and shall maintain all such PODs for at least twelve (12) months from the date of delivery, or for a period as proscribed by law; c) Bill of Lading (BOL): Carrier agrees that Niagara’s bill of lading shall be considered: (i) an acceptable form of receipt hereunder, and (ii) specific shipping instructions. These Standard Carrier T&C’s shall be incorporated by reference into each and every such BOL and in the event of an inconsistency, these Standard Carrier T&C’s shall control; and d) Supporting documents for Accessorial charges: Carrier agrees to provide all documents in accordance with Section 18 of these Standard Terms and Conditions.
Carrier Failure to provide Proof of Delivery (POD). In the event Carrier fails to provide a POD within 48 hours of delivery, Niagara shall have the right to deduct all amounts paid for Transportation Services, or demand payment for the amount of the Transportation Service invoice. Additionally, if Carrier cannot provide the POD within fourteen (14) days of delivery, Niagara may charge Carrier for the cost of any of Niagara’s customer’s invoice for product not paid. Alternatively, if Niagara receives a refusal to pay for a Load from its customer, Niagara will provide Carrier of evidence of customer refusal and proof of loss, and shall charge Carrier the cost of customer’s invoice for product.
Assignment and Subcontracting. Carrier agrees not to interline, use other motor carriers or brokers, or to use “substituted services” or otherwise assign or subcontract any portion of any Award, agreement or purchase order without the express written consent of Niagara. If, with the express written permission of Niagara, Carrier elects to use a delivery agent or subcontract the transportation of a Load, Carrier shall be the sole bearer of any costs associated with the delivery agent or subcontractor and agrees to be fully liable for any loss, damage, or delay to transportation of any such Loads while in this third party carrier’s care, custody and/or control. Carrier understands and agrees that all payments made by Niagara are conditioned upon Niagara’s receipt of a conditional waiver and release executed by Carrier and an unconditional waiver and release executed by each Additional Party. Carrier agrees to defend, indemnify and hold Niagara and its customer’s harmless from any and all claims of any Additional Party for payment. Carrier acknowledges and agrees that Carrier shall remain, at all times, fully liable for all Additional Parties. Carrier warrants that it shall ensure that Additional Parties comply with and adhere to all warranties, representations, obligations, terms and conditions contained herein.
Compliance with Law. At all times during the Award or agreement term or its relationship with Niagara, Carrier shall comply with all applicable state and federal laws. Additionally, Carrier shall operate all Carrier Equipment in compliance with industry standard, and shall maintain and operate the same such that Carrier’s safety rating does not fall below “satisfactory” under the Federal Motor Carrier Safety Administration standards. In the event that Carrier’s safety rating falls below a “satisfactory”, Carrier shall notify Niagara immediately, and Niagara will have the immediate right to terminate any Award, agreement or purchase order upon notice to Carrier.
Indemnification: a) Carrier agrees to indemnify, defend, and hold Niagara, its affiliates, and representatives harmless from and against any and all claims arising out of or related to any Award, agreement, or purchase order and/or Transportation Services that are the subject thereof, including but not limited to: (i) any bodily injury or property damage claims, and any liability, loss, cost, expense, or other damages (including reasonable attorney fees) brought about by any injury of any kind suffered by any person or property as a result of any act, neglect, default, omission of either the Carrier, Carrier’s agents, employees, affiliates, subcontractors, or any third party for whose actions Carrier is responsible (“Carrier Actors”), or Niagara, Niagara’s agents, employees, affiliates, subcontractors or other representatives; (ii) any negligent act, misfeasance, or nonfeasance by Carrier, or Carrier Actors; (iii) any harm, injury, damage, or loss arising out of or in connection with the Transportation Services provided; (iv) third party consumer claims, suits, and/or demands, including costs and expenses of investigation and settlement and attorneys’ fees and expenses, to the extent such claims arise from: (a) any act or omission by Carrier or Carrier Actors relating to or affecting the condition, quality, or character of any Goods or Services provided; or (b) trademark, copyright, trade dress, or patent infringement. Carrier acknowledges and agrees that Carrier must receive Niagara’s express written approval prior to settling any claim or lawsuit. Niagara reserves the right at any time to control its own defense. b) Should Carrier receive (or become aware of) any demand, service of process, notice, action, settlement, summons, complaint or the like from or by a third party alleging that a Party hereto is responsible for some injury, act, omission, breach, negligence, claim, loss, violation of law, settlement, cost, expense, obligation, liability, damage, recovery, deficiency or otherwise, including, without limitation, interest, penalties, reasonable attorney fees and costs (each, a “Claim”) that arises out of, results from, or in any way relates to the subject matter of these Standard Terms and Conditions, an Award, agreement or purchase order, then Carrier shall immediately (but no later than five (5) business days after receipt, or becoming aware, of a third party Claim) provide Niagara with written notice regarding each third party Claim of which Carrier is or becomes aware.

Such written notice must be sent to Vice President of Legal Affairs via email and certified mail (1) panderson@niagarawater.com, (2) 2560 E. Philadelphia St., Ontario, CA 91761. g) Waiver. Niagara’s delay, failure or partial exercise of any provision herein or waiver of any breach, right or remedy contained in or granted by any Award, agreement or purchase order shall not be deemed a waiver of any breach, right or remedy unless expressly stated as such by Niagara in writing signed by an authorized representative of Niagara, and then such waiver shall be limited solely to its specific terms.
Limitation of Liability. In no event shall Niagara be liable for any punitive, exemplary, special, incidental, indirect or consequential damages of any kind (including, but not limited to loss of profits, loss of reputation, and/or loss of current or prospective business advantage, when where such losses are characterized as direct damages) arising out of or in any way related to the relationship and/or dealings between Niagara and Carrier regardless of whether the claim under which damages are sought is based upon contract, tort, negligence, strict liability or otherwise, and regardless of whether the parties have been advised of the possibility of such damages at the time of contracting or otherwise. Under no circumstances shall Niagara’s maximum total liability, if any, arising out of or in any way related to the relationship and/or dealings between Niagara and Carrier exceed the amounts paid and/or due to Carrier by Niagara under any relationship between the Parties, Award, agreement or purchase order.
Liability for Loss, Damage or Delay to Loads. a) Carrier agrees that in the transportation of all Loads hereunder, it shall assume, and does assume, the liability of an interstate motor carrier, as provided by 49 U.S.C. § 14706, with such liability to exist from the time of the receipt of any of said goods by Carrier until proper delivery has been made to the location specified by Niagara. The Parties expressly decline to limit the value of the property as permitted by 49 U.S.C. § 14706(c). All claims will be filed and resolved in accordance with the ICC regulations in 49 CFR Part 370. b) All Loads tendered to Carrier for transportation will be palletized and stretch wrapped. Carrier reserves the right to refuse to accept any Load that is not so packaged. c) Parties agree that each incident of transportation of product under any Award, agreement or purchase order shall be evidenced by a BOL signed by Carrier and Niagara showing the kind, quantity, value and condition of products or goods received and delivered by Carrier at the loading and unloading points respectively. Carrier’s duties and responsibilities under any Award, agreement or purchase order between the Parties for the transport of any Load evidenced by such receipt shall commence when Carrier takes possession and control of Niagara’s property or upon execution of such receipt by Niagara, whichever occurs first, and shall end when consignee/customer/buyer signs a delivery receipt and Carrier delivers Niagara’s property. Carrier shall inspect all Loads prior to accepting possession and control and shall document any evidence of damage on the BOL. If Carrier does not indicate damage on the BOL at the time of possession and immediately communicates the existence of such damage to Niagara, Carrier agrees that damage documented upon delivery presumptively occurred while the Load was in Carrier’s custody and possession. d) The time limit within which Niagara must file a claim for damaged or lost products or goods against Carrier shall be nine (9) months from the date of delivery or within nine (9) months of the reasonably anticipated date of delivery in the event of a complete loss. All claims shall be paid, settled or disallowed by Carrier within ninety (90) days of filing. Disallowance shall state a lawful reason for declining to accept responsibility for the claim, and shall be stated by Carrier, not its insurer. In no event shall Niagara be required to work with Carrier’s insurer directly. Niagara agrees to immediately provide written notice of claim to Carrier showing kind, quantity, value and proof of carriage as evidenced by a signed BOL. e) In the event of Carrier’s breach, or alleged breach, as determined solely by Niagara, of any provision in any Award, agreement or purchase order between the Parties, in addition to all other remedies in law or equity that are available to Niagara, Carrier shall be responsible for all reasonable attorneys’ fees and costs incurred by Niagara as a result of said breach or alleged breach.
Product Loss or Damage. a) Rejected Load. In the event the Niagara’s customer rejects the delivery of any Load due to the fault of Carrier, Carrier must return the Load to the pick-up origin designated by Niagara at no cost. In the event Niagara’s customer rejects the delivery of a Load due to no fault of the Carrier, Niagara shall pay a transportation rate equal to the rate Niagara paid Carrier to transport the Load to Niagara’s customer. Any and all rejected Loads not scheduled for redelivery must be delivered back to Niagara’s pick-up origin within five (5) days from the time/date of initial pick-up. Any Load being transported back to Niagara’s pick-up origin must be secured with either a seal or padlock and a confirmation must be sent via email to executionteam@niagarawater.com. Return charges for shorthaul clusters will be returned at half the published rate of the Load. For long haul cluster freight, return charges will not exceed the total all-in rate of the Load. b) Visual Damage to Products. 1) For damages to individual cases of product up to less than one pallet, Niagara’s customer must note the damage on the BOL, and customer or Carrier may dispose of or donate damaged cases of product. 2) For damage to one or more pallets, Niagara’s customer must note the damage on the BOL. If the Load is rejected and remains in the custody of Carrier, Carrier must immediately contact Niagara Dispatch for deposition instructions. Carrier must provide the purchase order number, date and time of single delivery, number of pallets damaged and/or refused, bottle code, any photographs, a brief description of the damage, and contact information, including contact name, phone number, email and facsimile number. c) Concealed Damage to Products. If Niagara’s customer reports concealed damage to the product, pallet and/or Load, such damage will be investigated to determine liability. If the investigation concludes that Carrier is responsible for the damage, Carrier will be notified of Niagara’s intent to file a claim and will be given the opportunity to inspect the product, pallet, or Load prior to disposition for disposal or donation. d) Product Loss/Delay. In the event Carrier is unable to execute delivery for reasons such as theft of Load, vehicular accident, or delay impacting the product’s integrity (i.e., non-delivery of Load/products to its specified destination within five (5) calendar days), recovery of loss will be executed pursuant to 49 CFR 370. e) Donation/Disposal. Due to product liability, trademark protection, and/or licensing agreements for private label stock, any distressed, damaged or otherwise rejected shipment that is not returned to a Niagara facility, for whatever reason, must be properly disposed of or donated in accordance with Niagara’s express written instruction. IN NO CIRCUMSTANCE CAN ANY GOODS, PRODUCTS OR INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY EVER BE RE-SOLD. Carrier understands and agrees that in no event shall Carrier nor any Carrier Actors, without the prior express written consent of Niagara: (i) cause, suffer or permit the transfer, salvage, disposal and/or donation of any Goods, Products or Intellectual Property, and/or (ii) offer to transfer, salvage, dispose of and/or donate any Goods, Products or Intellectual Property, whether as salvage or otherwise. Notwithstanding the foregoing, if there is a distressed, damaged or otherwise rejected Load of product that is not returned to a Niagara facility, and Niagara gives express written permission to a Carrier to dispose of or donate the goods or products, Niagara shall require written verification, signed by the Carrier’s authorized agent, which provides exact details as to the final disposition as well as copies of donation/disposal receipts as backup. f) Claim Settlement. In order to close a freight claim as settled, one of the following conclusions must be obtained: • Granted: paid in full • Declined: written declination including a specific legal reason • Compromised: written offer to settle for less than the original claim amount, including legal rationale for offer to pay less than full amount claimed g) Payment. Any and all payments from Carrier to Niagara in settlement of a claim must be made, in full, and sent to: Niagara Bottling, LLC 2560 E. Philadelphia Street Ontario, CA 91761 Attention: Claims Specialist Niagara’s claim reference number must appear on the check. A partial payment check will not be accepted and will not be cashed as a granted or settled claim.
Seals. Carrier agrees to comply with the Food and Drug Administration and industry standards with regard to seals as codified in FDA 21 CFR 110.93, which states that all transportation of food shall be under conditions to protect that food. Storage and transportation of finished food shall be under conditions that will protect the food against physical, chemical, and microbial contamination as well as against deterioration of the food and the container, Carrier further agrees to use standard industry practices, including, but not limited to ensuring that any and all trailers from or on behalf of Niagara will be kept sealed while transporting all goods. Carrier must confirm that the seal has been secured on the trailer and that the seal number is recorded on the BOL by Niagara prior to leaving any of Niagara’s facilities. If the seal is required to be broken at any time during transport, Carrier must first seek Niagara’s authorization. Carrier must then notify Niagara that the trailer has been re-sealed by sending an e-mail to executionteam@niagarawater.com. In the event Niagara’s customer breaks the seal, rejects the Load, and does not provide Carrier with a new seal to re-seal the trailer, Niagara’s customer or Carrier must add a lock to the trailer to secure the Load. It is Carrier’s sole responsibility to ensure that the trailer is re-sealed or a lock is added to the trailer prior to leaving Niagara’s customer’s facilities. No Loads will be accepted by Niagara without a seal or lock on the trailer.
Insurance. During the term of all Awards, agreements or purchase orders, and after any termination of or expiration, and for as long as Carrier owes any obligation to Niagara and/or any statute of limitations for any potential claim that Niagara may have against Carrier remains unexpired, Carrier and any Carrier Actors shall maintain all insurance and/or bonds required by statute, law and any Award, agreement or purchase order with minimum insurance limits consistent with Niagara’s insurance requirements set forth at the end of this Section 16. Should insurance policy limits be exhausted or should Carrier or any Carrier Actors fail to maintain the required insurance coverage, neither Carrier nor any Carrier Actor will in any way be relieved from liability provided for herein to Niagara should a loss occur. Carrier shall furnish Niagara with a certificate evidencing the aforementioned coverage limits via email to insurancecerts@niagarawater.com. Such certificate shall provide for thirty (30) days written notice to Niagara in the event of cancellation. All certificates of insurance shall name Niagara Bottling, LLC and its parents, subsidiaries, employees, agents, affiliates and assigns as an additional insured by policy endorsement (on both Carrier’s General Liability Policy, Automobile Liability Policy and Cargo Insurance Policy) and waive all rights of subrogation against Niagara, its parent, director, officers, employees, stockholders, subsidiaries and affiliates with regard to Employee Liability and Workers Compensation. For any claims relating to an Agreement, agreement or purchase order, the Carrier’s insurance shall be deemed to be primary and not contributing to or in excess of any similar coverage purchased by Niagara. Carrier hereby acknowledges that naming Niagara Bottling, LLC and its parents, subsidiaries, employees, agents, affiliates and assigns as an additional insured by policy endorsement is a condition precedent to payment by Niagara. For the avoidance of doubt, Niagara will not be required to submit payment until the requirements of this provision have been met. However, failure of Niagara to demand any certificates or to identify any deficiency in the insurance provided shall not be construed as or deemed to be a waiver of the Carrier’s (or its agents or subcontractors) obligation to maintain such insurance. If any of the coverages are required to remain in force after termination of the Agreement, Carrier shall submit additional certificates evidencing continuation of coverage until such obligation ends. Niagara’s Minimum Insurance Requirements: Commercial General Liability $2,000,000 per occurrence; $5,000,000 aggregate Auto Liability $3,000,000 combined single limit Cargo $100,000 Employee Liability/Workman’s Comp $2,000,000/Statutory In addition to the general insurance requirements provided in the above table, customized insurance requirements for specific Seller-types are attached hereto and incorporated herein by this reference.
Termination. a) Any Award, agreement or purchase order shall commence on the date such Award is given, agreement is entered into or purchase order is issued, and shall automatically renew on a year-to-year basis until terminated, provided that Carrier is performing in accordance with these Carrier Standard T&C’s, the Award, agreement or purchase order, and that Carrier continues to provide Niagara the lowest available rates in the market and the lowest rates and/or most favorable terms at which Carrier offers its service to any third party shipper in the same functional level of the trade as Niagara (“Most Favorable Rates”). The Parties agree to meet in good faith to discuss existing rates at a time no earlier than twelve (12) months after the Award is issued or an agreement is entered into by the Parties. Such discussions may result in a rate adjustment if, and only if, the adjustment is in reference to driver pay, and only upon mutual written consent by both Parties. Notwithstanding the foregoing, Carrier guarantees that any rate increase will not exceed 2% of the current rate. In the event that Carrier does not provide Niagara with the Most Favorable Rates, Niagara shall have the right to terminate by giving thirty (30) days written notice to Carrier. b) If during the term specified by any Award, agreement, or purchase order either party (i) files a petition in bankruptcy or has a petition in bankruptcy filed against it that is not dismissed within sixty (60) days, or (ii) makes a general assignment for the benefit of creditors, then in any such case the non-bankrupt party may terminate any Award, agreement or purchase order by giving written notice of such effect to the bankrupt party. c) If all or any portion of Carrier’s registration, as required by any Award, agreement or purchase order, is revoked, canceled, suspended, or discontinued by operation of law or otherwise (“Registration Issue”), or if Carrier’s insurance policies are canceled, reduced or otherwise invalidated (“Insurance Issue”), Carrier shall promptly notify Niagara, and in no case later than forty-eight (48) hours after Carrier learns of any such Registration or Insurance Issue and Niagara shall have the right to terminate any Award, agreement or purchase order immediately and/ or collect reimbursement for all expenses it has incurred in preparation of and/ or as a result of any Award, agreement or purchase order from Carrier. Carrier’s notification to Niagara in regards to the above shall in no way serve as a waiver by Niagara of its right to construe such as a breach of any Award, agreement or purchase order and shall in no way limit Niagara’s right to pursue all remedies in law or equity as a result of such breach. d) If, in Niagara’s sole discretion, delays in transportation cause inconvenience and/or harm to Niagara’s business interests, or Carrier is otherwise in breach of any Award, agreement or purchase order, Niagara shall provide written notice to Carrier outlining the delay and resulting or anticipated harm and/or breach. If the deficiencies and/or breach remain following a period of thirty (30) days from the date written notice was provided, as is measured as of the date specified on the notice, Niagara may terminate any Award, agreement or purchase order upon thirty (30) days written notice to Carrier. e) In the event of any discontinuation and/or revision to any regulations and/or laws in the United States (or any other country where Carrier services Niagara), and/or if Niagara, in its sole discretion, determines that the services contemplated in any Award, agreement or purchase order are no longer necessary or required and/or that Niagara’s course of business strategy has changed, Niagara may terminate any Award, agreement or purchase order in part or in its entirety upon sixty (60) days’ notice to Carrier. f) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary herein, Niagara shall have the ability to terminate any Award, agreement or purchase order for convenience with a sixty (60) day written notice, and Carrier shall have the ability to terminate any Award or agreement with one hundred eighty (180) day written notice to Niagara.

Niagara plans to construct a new, highly automated manufacturing facility in Kenton County, located in the city of Elsmere, Kentucky beginning in late 2024. The project will be located at the C5 Airport East Logistics Center. The 52-acre site was developed by CORE5 Industrial Partners and supported by state and local officials. The facility will be the company’s first location in Kentucky. The BE-NKY Growth Partnership was instrumental in facilitating site selection for the project.
The new facility will include 436,800 square feet of advanced manufacturing space including beverage production and distribution operations. It will utilize state of the art equipment and technology focused on environmental efficiency and sustainability. Niagara’s capital investment is anticipated to be over $120 million when the project is completed. In addition to utility fees, the project is also anticipated to generate over $300,000 in local property tax revenues annually.
Total employment is estimated to be 60 full-time positions with an initial annual payroll of approximately $5.6 million including important benefits such as retirement and medical insurance in addition to bonuses and overtime compensation. Niagara offers significant job training opportunities and formal professional development programs, supporting promotions and career advancements from within.

Our Focus on Sustainability
Niagara is committed to responsible resource usage and integrating sustainability into every aspect of our business.

Here’s how Niagara is putting sustainability first:
Water Stewardship:
A Niagara facility uses less water to produce its products than it takes to keep a few golf courses green. Niagara pays volumetric fees for the water it uses and millions in taxes and fees to municipal systems that enable them to maintain and improve their infrastructure.
Packaging Efficiency:
Niagara uses the least amount of plastic for its bottles.
Lowest Environmental Impact:
Niagara PET bottles have a lower environmental impact across most impact categories when compared to other common beverage and water packaging types. Our half-liter bottles have an embodied carbon footprint that is 46% below the U.S. average.

Recycling Infrastructure and Education:
Niagara supports recycling education through International Bottled Water Association’s “Put it in the Bin” campaign and the “Keep the Cap On” campaign.

Indemnification: a) Carrier agrees to indemnify, defend, and hold Niagara, its affiliates, and representatives harmless from and against any and all claims arising out of or related to any Award, agreement, or purchase order and/or Transportation Services that are the subject thereof, including but not limited to: (i) any bodily injury or property damage claims, and any liability, loss, cost, expense, or other damages (including reasonable attorney fees) brought about by any injury of any kind suffered by any person or property as a result of any act, neglect, default, omission of either the Carrier, Carrier’s agents, employees, affiliates, subcontractors, or any third party for whose actions Carrier is responsible (“Carrier Actors”), or Niagara, Niagara’s agents, employees, affiliates, subcontractors or other representatives; (ii) any negligent act, misfeasance, or nonfeasance by Carrier, or Carrier Actors; (iii) any harm, injury, damage, or loss arising out of or in connection with the Transportation Services provided; (iv) third party consumer claims, suits, and/or demands, including costs and expenses of investigation and settlement and attorneys’ fees and expenses, to the extent such claims arise from: (a) any act or omission by Carrier or Carrier Actors relating to or affecting the condition, quality, or character of any Goods or Services provided; or (b) trademark, copyright, trade dress, or patent infringement. Carrier acknowledges and agrees that Carrier must receive Niagara’s express written approval prior to settling any claim or lawsuit. Niagara reserves the right at any time to control its own defense. b) Should Carrier receive (or become aware of) any demand, service of process, notice, action, settlement, summons, complaint or the like from or by a third party alleging that a Party hereto is responsible for some injury, act, omission, breach, negligence, claim, loss, violation of law, settlement, cost, expense, obligation, liability, damage, recovery, deficiency or otherwise, including, without limitation, interest, penalties, reasonable attorney fees and costs (each, a “Claim”) that arises out of, results from, or in any way relates to the subject matter of these Standard Terms and Conditions, an Award, agreement or purchase order, then Carrier shall immediately (but no later than five (5) business days after receipt, or becoming aware, of a third party Claim) provide Niagara with written notice regarding each third party Claim of which Carrier is or becomes aware. Carrier covenants and agrees that should Carrier fail to provide Niagara with timely written notice regarding any third party Claim, Carrier hereby generally and expressly waives, relinquishes and releases, and agrees to hold harmless, Niagara from and against any and all Claims capable of being asserted by Carrier against Niagara in connection therewith. c) In the event Carrier utilizes any party (“Additional Party”) regardless of that party’s legal designation of contractor, subcontractor, materials supplier, agent, or otherwise, for the purpose of performing any Transportation Services, Carrier shall submit to Niagara written notice of (i) each Additional Party, (ii) the duties each Additional Party will undertake, (iii) the amount of compensation each Additional Party is to receive from Carrier, and (iv) Carrier’s compensation schedule and payment terms with the Additional Party. Carrier understands submitting this written notice as set forth above is a condition precedent to payment. Such written notice must be sent to Vice President of Legal Affairs via email and certified mail (1) panderson@niagarawater.com, (2) 2560 E. Philadelphia St., Ontario, CA 91761. g) Waiver. Niagara’s delay, failure or partial exercise of any provision herein or waiver of any breach, right or remedy contained in or granted by any Award, agreement or purchase order shall not be deemed a waiver of any breach, right or remedy unless expressly stated as such by Niagara in writing signed by an authorized representative of Niagara, and then such waiver shall be limited solely to its specific terms.
Limitation of Liability. In no event shall Niagara be liable for any punitive, exemplary, special, incidental, indirect or consequential damages of any kind (including, but not limited to loss of profits, loss of reputation, and/or loss of current or prospective business advantage, when where such losses are characterized as direct damages) arising out of or in any way related to the relationship and/or dealings between Niagara and Carrier regardless of whether the claim under which damages are sought is based upon contract, tort, negligence, strict liability or otherwise, and regardless of whether the parties have been advised of the possibility of such damages at the time of contracting or otherwise. Under no circumstances shall Niagara’s maximum total liability, if any, arising out of or in any way related to the relationship and/or dealings between Niagara and Carrier exceed the amounts paid and/or due to Carrier by Niagara under any relationship between the Parties, Award, agreement or purchase order.
Liability for Loss, Damage or Delay to Loads. a) Carrier agrees that in the transportation of all Loads hereunder, it shall assume, and does assume, the liability of an interstate motor carrier, as provided by 49 U.S.C. § 14706, with such liability to exist from the time of the receipt of any of said goods by Carrier until proper delivery has been made to the location specified by Niagara. The Parties expressly decline to limit the value of the property as permitted by 49 U.S.C. § 14706(c). All claims will be filed and resolved in accordance with the ICC regulations in 49 CFR Part 370. b) All Loads tendered to Carrier for transportation will be palletized and stretch wrapped. Carrier reserves the right to refuse to accept any Load that is not so packaged. c) Parties agree that each incident of transportation of product under any Award, agreement or purchase order shall be evidenced by a BOL signed by Carrier and Niagara showing the kind, quantity, value and condition of products or goods received and delivered by Carrier at the loading and unloading points respectively. Carrier’s duties and responsibilities under any Award, agreement or purchase order between the Parties for the transport of any Load evidenced by such receipt shall commence when Carrier takes possession and control of Niagara’s property or upon execution of such receipt by Niagara, whichever occurs first, and shall end when consignee/customer/buyer signs a delivery receipt and Carrier delivers Niagara’s property. Carrier shall inspect all Loads prior to accepting possession and control and shall document any evidence of damage on the BOL. If Carrier does not indicate damage on the BOL at the time of possession and immediately communicates the existence of such damage to Niagara, Carrier agrees that damage documented upon delivery presumptively occurred while the Load was in Carrier’s custody and possession. d) The time limit within which Niagara must file a claim for damaged or lost products or goods against Carrier shall be nine (9) months from the date of delivery or within nine (9) months of the reasonably anticipated date of delivery in the event of a complete loss. All claims shall be paid, settled or disallowed by Carrier within ninety (90) days of filing. Disallowance shall state a lawful reason for declining to accept responsibility for the claim, and shall be stated by Carrier, not its insurer. In no event shall Niagara be required to work with Carrier’s insurer directly. Niagara agrees to immediately provide written notice of claim to Carrier showing kind, quantity, value and proof of carriage as evidenced by a signed BOL. e) In the event of Carrier’s breach, or alleged breach, as determined solely by Niagara, of any provision in any Award, agreement or purchase order between the Parties, in addition to all other remedies in law or equity that are available to Niagara, Carrier shall be responsible for all reasonable attorneys’ fees and costs incurred by Niagara as a result of said breach or alleged breach.
Product Loss or Damage. a) Rejected Load. In the event the Niagara’s customer rejects the delivery of any Load due to the fault of Carrier, Carrier must return the Load to the pick-up origin designated by Niagara at no cost. In the event Niagara’s customer rejects the delivery of a Load due to no fault of the Carrier, Niagara shall pay a transportation rate equal to the rate Niagara paid Carrier to transport the Load to Niagara’s customer. Any and all rejected Loads not scheduled for redelivery must be delivered back to Niagara’s pick-up origin within five (5) days from the time/date of initial pick-up. Any Load being transported back to Niagara’s pick-up origin must be secured with either a seal or padlock and a confirmation must be sent via email to executionteam@niagarawater.com. Return charges for shorthaul clusters will be returned at half the published rate of the Load. For long haul cluster freight, return charges will not exceed the total all-in rate of the Load. b) Visual Damage to Products. 1) For damages to individual cases of product up to less than one pallet, Niagara’s customer must note the damage on the BOL, and customer or Carrier may dispose of or donate damaged cases of product. 2) For damage to one or more pallets, Niagara’s customer must note the damage on the BOL. If the Load is rejected and remains in the custody of Carrier, Carrier must immediately contact Niagara Dispatch for deposition instructions. Carrier must provide the purchase order number, date and time of single delivery, number of pallets damaged and/or refused, bottle code, any photographs, a brief description of the damage, and contact information, including contact name, phone number, email and facsimile number. c) Concealed Damage to Products. If Niagara’s customer reports concealed damage to the product, pallet and/or Load, such damage will be investigated to determine liability. If the investigation concludes that Carrier is responsible for the damage, Carrier will be notified of Niagara’s intent to file a claim and will be given the opportunity to inspect the product, pallet, or Load prior to disposition for disposal or donation. d) Product Loss/Delay. In the event Carrier is unable to execute delivery for reasons such as theft of Load, vehicular accident, or delay impacting the product’s integrity (i.e., non-delivery of Load/products to its specified destination within five (5) calendar days), recovery of loss will be executed pursuant to 49 CFR 370. e) Donation/Disposal. Due to product liability, trademark protection, and/or licensing agreements for private label stock, any distressed, damaged or otherwise rejected shipment that is not returned to a Niagara facility, for whatever reason, must be properly disposed of or donated in accordance with Niagara’s express written instruction. IN NO CIRCUMSTANCE CAN ANY GOODS, PRODUCTS OR INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY EVER BE RE-SOLD. Carrier understands and agrees that in no event shall Carrier nor any Carrier Actors, without the prior express written consent of Niagara: (i) cause, suffer or permit the transfer, salvage, disposal and/or donation of any Goods, Products or Intellectual Property, and/or (ii) offer to transfer, salvage, dispose of and/or donate any Goods, Products or Intellectual Property, whether as salvage or otherwise. Notwithstanding the foregoing, if there is a distressed, damaged or otherwise rejected Load of product that is not returned to a Niagara facility, and Niagara gives express written permission to a Carrier to dispose of or donate the goods or products, Niagara shall require written verification, signed by the Carrier’s authorized agent, which provides exact details as to the final disposition as well as copies of donation/disposal receipts as backup. f) Claim Settlement. In order to close a freight claim as settled, one of the following conclusions must be obtained: • Granted: paid in full • Declined: written declination including a specific legal reason • Compromised: written offer to settle for less than the original claim amount, including legal rationale for offer to pay less than full amount claimed g) Payment. Any and all payments from Carrier to Niagara in settlement of a claim must be made, in full, and sent to: Niagara Bottling, LLC 2560 E. Philadelphia Street Ontario, CA 91761 Attention: Claims Specialist Niagara’s claim reference number must appear on the check. A partial payment check will not be accepted and will not be cashed as a granted or settled claim.
Seals. Carrier agrees to comply with the Food and Drug Administration and industry standards with regard to seals as codified in FDA 21 CFR 110.93, which states that all transportation of food shall be under conditions to protect that food. Storage and transportation of finished food shall be under conditions that will protect the food against physical, chemical, and microbial contamination as well as against deterioration of the food and the container, Carrier further agrees to use standard industry practices, including, but not limited to ensuring that any and all trailers from or on behalf of Niagara will be kept sealed while transporting all goods. Carrier must confirm that the seal has been secured on the trailer and that the seal number is recorded on the BOL by Niagara prior to leaving any of Niagara’s facilities. If the seal is required to be broken at any time during transport, Carrier must first seek Niagara’s authorization. Carrier must then notify Niagara that the trailer has been re-sealed by sending an e-mail to executionteam@niagarawater.com. In the event Niagara’s customer breaks the seal, rejects the Load, and does not provide Carrier with a new seal to re-seal the trailer, Niagara’s customer or Carrier must add a lock to the trailer to secure the Load. It is Carrier’s sole responsibility to ensure that the trailer is re-sealed or a lock is added to the trailer prior to leaving Niagara’s customer’s facilities. No Loads will be accepted by Niagara without a seal or lock on the trailer.
Insurance. During the term of all Awards, agreements or purchase orders, and after any termination of or expiration, and for as long as Carrier owes any obligation to Niagara and/or any statute of limitations for any potential claim that Niagara may have against Carrier remains unexpired, Carrier and any Carrier Actors shall maintain all insurance and/or bonds required by statute, law and any Award, agreement or purchase order with minimum insurance limits consistent with Niagara’s insurance requirements set forth at the end of this Section 16. Should insurance policy limits be exhausted or should Carrier or any Carrier Actors fail to maintain the required insurance coverage, neither Carrier nor any Carrier Actor will in any way be relieved from liability provided for herein to Niagara should a loss occur. Carrier shall furnish Niagara with a certificate evidencing the aforementioned coverage limits via email to insurancecerts@niagarawater.com. Such certificate shall provide for thirty (30) days written notice to Niagara in the event of cancellation. All certificates of insurance shall name Niagara Bottling, LLC and its parents, subsidiaries, employees, agents, affiliates and assigns as an additional insured by policy endorsement (on both Carrier’s General Liability Policy, Automobile Liability Policy and Cargo Insurance Policy) and waive all rights of subrogation against Niagara, its parent, director, officers, employees, stockholders, subsidiaries and affiliates with regard to Employee Liability and Workers Compensation. For any claims relating to an Agreement, agreement or purchase order, the Carrier’s insurance shall be deemed to be primary and not contributing to or in excess of any similar coverage purchased by Niagara. Carrier hereby acknowledges that naming Niagara Bottling, LLC and its parents, subsidiaries, employees, agents, affiliates and assigns as an additional insured by policy endorsement is a condition precedent to payment by Niagara. For the avoidance of doubt, Niagara will not be required to submit payment until the requirements of this provision have been met. However, failure of Niagara to demand any certificates or to identify any deficiency in the insurance provided shall not be construed as or deemed to be a waiver of the Carrier’s (or its agents or subcontractors) obligation to maintain such insurance. If any of the coverages are required to remain in force after termination of the Agreement, Carrier shall submit additional certificates evidencing continuation of coverage until such obligation ends. Niagara’s Minimum Insurance Requirements: Commercial General Liability $2,000,000 per occurrence; $5,000,000 aggregate Auto Liability $3,000,000 combined single limit Cargo $100,000 Employee Liability/Workman’s Comp $2,000,000/Statutory In addition to the general insurance requirements provided in the above table, customized insurance requirements for specific Seller-types are attached hereto and incorporated herein by this reference.
Termination. a) Any Award, agreement or purchase order shall commence on the date such Award is given, agreement is entered into or purchase order is issued, and shall automatically renew on a year-to-year basis until terminated, provided that Carrier is performing in accordance with these Carrier Standard T&C’s, the Award, agreement or purchase order, and that Carrier continues to provide Niagara the lowest available rates in the market and the lowest rates and/or most favorable terms at which Carrier offers its service to any third party shipper in the same functional level of the trade as Niagara (“Most Favorable Rates”). The Parties agree to meet in good faith to discuss existing rates at a time no earlier than twelve (12) months after the Award is issued or an agreement is entered into by the Parties. Such discussions may result in a rate adjustment if, and only if, the adjustment is in reference to driver pay, and only upon mutual written consent by both Parties. Notwithstanding the foregoing, Carrier guarantees that any rate increase will not exceed 2% of the current rate. In the event that Carrier does not provide Niagara with the Most Favorable Rates, Niagara shall have the right to terminate by giving thirty (30) days written notice to Carrier. b) If during the term specified by any Award, agreement, or purchase order either party (i) files a petition in bankruptcy or has a petition in bankruptcy filed against it that is not dismissed within sixty (60) days, or (ii) makes a general assignment for the benefit of creditors, then in any such case the non-bankrupt party may terminate any Award, agreement or purchase order by giving written notice of such effect to the bankrupt party. c) If all or any portion of Carrier’s registration, as required by any Award, agreement or purchase order, is revoked, canceled, suspended, or discontinued by operation of law or otherwise (“Registration Issue”), or if Carrier’s insurance policies are canceled, reduced or otherwise invalidated (“Insurance Issue”), Carrier shall promptly notify Niagara, and in no case later than forty-eight (48) hours after Carrier learns of any such Registration or Insurance Issue and Niagara shall have the right to terminate any Award, agreement or purchase order immediately and/ or collect reimbursement for all expenses it has incurred in preparation of and/ or as a result of any Award, agreement or purchase order from Carrier. Carrier’s notification to Niagara in regards to the above shall in no way serve as a waiver by Niagara of its right to construe such as a breach of any Award, agreement or purchase order and shall in no way limit Niagara’s right to pursue all remedies in law or equity as a result of such breach. d) If, in Niagara’s sole discretion, delays in transportation cause inconvenience and/or harm to Niagara’s business interests, or Carrier is otherwise in breach of any Award, agreement or purchase order, Niagara shall provide written notice to Carrier outlining the delay and resulting or anticipated harm and/or breach. If the deficiencies and/or breach remain following a period of thirty (30) days from the date written notice was provided, as is measured as of the date specified on the notice, Niagara may terminate any Award, agreement or purchase order upon thirty (30) days written notice to Carrier. e) In the event of any discontinuation and/or revision to any regulations and/or laws in the United States (or any other country where Carrier services Niagara), and/or if Niagara, in its sole discretion, determines that the services contemplated in any Award, agreement or purchase order are no longer necessary or required and/or that Niagara’s course of business strategy has changed, Niagara may terminate any Award, agreement or purchase order in part or in its entirety upon sixty (60) days’ notice to Carrier. f) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary herein, Niagara shall have the ability to terminate any Award, agreement or purchase order for convenience with a sixty (60) day written notice, and Carrier shall have the ability to terminate any Award or agreement with one hundred eighty (180) day written notice to Niagara.
