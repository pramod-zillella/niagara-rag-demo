Although innovation is the key to our success at Niagara, our family tradition of high quality, value priced bottled water will never change. Niagara continues to grow and is the leading private label bottled water company in the United States.

Andrew Peykoff Sr. started bottling high quality low cost Niagara® water in five-gallon glass containers for home and office delivery in 1963. The Niagara tradition of quality, integrity, hard work, and great customer service made Niagara a household name in Southern California.

In the early ‘90s, Niagara expanded into offering single-serve private label bottled water for grocery, club store, convenience, and wholesale customers with the same focus on offering an unmatched combination of quality, price, and service.

Throughout the following decade, Niagara’s significant developments in vertical integration, innovative bottle design, and high-speed manufacturing positioned the company as the industry leading private label bottled water supplier in the Western United States.

Niagara’s family owned and operated status continued with Andy Peykoff II becoming President and CEO in 2002. Since then, Niagara has established itself as a national leader in high quality affordable bottled water with geographically diversified production facilities throughout the United States.

The dedication to operational improvements, a consistent recipe of hard work, integrity, attention to detail, and the relentless quest for perfection has driven Niagara to become the largest family owned and operated bottled water company in the United States.

Much has changed since 1963; however, the Niagara family tradition of high quality low cost bottled water has not. From the Niagara family to yours, we invite you to Taste the Pure Difference!®

**State of the Art Purification**  
Niagara Bottling utilizes state-of-the-art purification, filtration, and disinfection technologies to produce safe and refreshing products for our customers to enjoy. Niagara Bottling is pleased to provide you with this water quality report.

**History**  
It all started back in 1963 when Andrew Peykoff Sr. began to bottle high-quality, low-cost Niagara water in 5-gallon glass containers for home and office delivery. With his insurmountable work ethic, integrity, and customer service, Niagara soon became a household name in Southern California. The customer base quickly expanded, and Niagara started providing single-serve private label bottled water to grocery, club, and convenience stores, as well as wholesale customers, all the while maintaining family-owned business values.  

Over the following decades, Niagara made significant advancements in high-speed manufacturing and innovative bottle design; it’s no wonder why Niagara is now considered the largest family-owned and operated bottled water company in the United States. The company now has 49 manufacturing facilities and is continuing to grow under CEO Andy Peykoff II.

**Mission Statement**  
Niagara’s mission is to be the premier national bottled water supplier by providing our customers unmatched quality, price, and service. We achieve this through the relentless pursuit of cutting-edge bottling technology, vertical integration, and ongoing improvement of process efficiencies. Ultimately, our mission can only be obtained through our most important competitive advantage: our people. The hard work, integrity, and dedication of every Niagara team member will shape the future success of our company for generations to come.

**Light Weight Bottles & Vertical Integration**  
As innovators, Niagara is always looking for ways to improve through technological advancements and processes that help reduce our impact on the environment. Niagara Bottling was the first to successfully implement corrugate-free nested packs, which enabled a 17% increase in cases per pallet, resulting in a reduction in raw material usage and increased transportation efficiency. This case pack format has since become an industry standard.  

Since 2010, Niagara has progressively reduced the amount of plastic in our bottles, achieving a 24% reduction in average bottle weight from 2010 to 2023, in addition to being one of the lightest water bottles in the world.  

Through this optimization and several other initiatives, Niagara:  
- From 2017 to 2023, Niagara has reduced its carbon emission intensity per gallon produced by 32%.  
- Niagara has added 70 MW of renewable electricity since 2019, including off-site wind power, which provides 100% renewable electricity to four facilities.  
- Has the lowest ratio of packaging weight to product of any material used for single-serve bottled water.  
- The company has reduced its average length of haul by over 70% since 2009, minimizing energy used in transportation.  
- Niagara Bottling was the first bottled water company in North America to earn TRUE Zero Waste Gold certification in 2017, diverting over 95% of waste from landfill. By the end of 2023, half of the company’s plants achieved Gold certification, and one reached Platinum.  

Our goal is to continue with dematerialization and process optimization through innovative science and technology. This is all made possible by our vertically integrated process where bottles are molded into shape and filled all on the same line. Complete process control is easily maintained and constantly improved in our own facilities according to our process capabilities.  

Niagara has certified 25 manufacturing sites in North America with Green Building Certification Inc.’s (GBCI) Total Resource Use and Efficiency (TRUE) zero waste certification at the gold or platinum levels. Between 2019-2023, Niagara planted over 5,000 sqft of microforests (densely packed native plants that help stormwater management and carbon capture) onsite at four manufacturing sites in Texas, Missouri, and California.  

In 2022, Niagara’s headquarters building achieved gold certification under the Leadership in Energy and Environmental Design (LEED) certification system.

---

**Sustainability Initiatives**  
All Niagara facilities are audited on a monthly basis by the Niagara Quality Assurance team and on an annual basis by third-party auditors such as the National Sanitation Foundation (NSF), FDA, and the International Bottled Water Association (IBWA). Additionally, Niagara participates in regular customer audits to ensure compliance with varying customer requirements. These audits help to ensure that the company meets federal and industry standards for sanitation and process controls. For the last 11 years, all Niagara facilities have been certified as SQF Level 3 through NSF or Eurofins, which is the highest level of certification attainable. SQF Level 3 certification is internationally recognized by the Global Food Safety Initiative (GFSI).

**Production**  
Niagara utilizes high-speed manufacturing equipment, and each production line has the capability to produce 1,200 bottles of water per minute. Maintaining quality at such high speeds is critical to our success. This is why Niagara utilizes state-of-the-art technology to continuously perform visual checks during the entire production process. Visual check systems are able to recognize and reject bottles that have defects such as under-filled bottles, misaligned caps, improperly aligned labels, and much more. The QA team also monitors several aspects of the water purification process daily to ensure that we are producing a safe and consistent product. On-site QA laboratories ensure that results are obtained quickly.

**Certified Plant Operators**  
Our product quality and overall success depend on the knowledge and strength of our team members. All Quality Assurance team members are required to pass an internationally recognized exam on bottled water manufacturing and quality, which is administered by IBWA. All water bottled by Niagara comes from carefully sourced springs, wells, and/or municipal water supplies. Each source is tested as it enters our facility to ensure compliance with state and federal regulations. The product is then monitored and tested through the purification and bottling process to ensure we continue to make a consistently high-quality product. Screening is conducted for more than 190 chemical attributes as well as physical and flavor characteristics. This level of testing surpasses the requirements set in place by the United States Food and Drug Administration (FDA) or the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA).

---

**Our Commitment To Quality**  
With its own set of testing requirements and good manufacturing standards, the bottled water industry is one of the most highly regulated in the United States. Bottled water is regulated by the FDA, which is also responsible for regulating the food and pharmaceutical industries. Tap water, on the other hand, is regulated by the EPA. Under the Safe Drinking Water Act, FDA regulations for bottled water must be at least as stringent as the EPA’s Primary Drinking Water Standards (known as Maximum Contaminant Levels). Bottled water is generally required to be tested for the same parameters as tap water, but the standards are, in many cases, stricter than for tap water. Ensuring the safety of the water is our primary objective in providing bottled water products to our customers.

**Water Standards of Identity**  
Since the bottled water industry is regulated by the FDA, they have established standards of identity for several types of bottled water. This ensures that each type of bottled water meets minimum standards. The following are examples of types of bottled water on the market. Niagara currently bottles spring water, purified water, and purified water with minerals added.

- **Spring Water**: Bottled water derived from an underground formation from which water flows naturally to the surface of the earth. Spring water can only be collected at the spring or through a borehole tapping the underground formation feeding the spring.  
- **Purified & Distilled Water**: Bottled water that has been produced by distillation, deionization, reverse osmosis, or other suitable processes while meeting the definition of purified water in the United States Pharmacopoeia. Other suitable names for bottled water treated by one of the above processes may include “distilled water” if it is produced by distillation, “deionized water” if it is produced by deionization, etc.  
- **Mineral Water**: Bottled water containing not less than 250 parts per million total dissolved solids. Mineral water is distinguished from other types of bottled water by its constant level and relative proportions of mineral and trace elements at the point of emergence from the source. No minerals can be added to this product.  
- **Sparkling Bottled Water**: Water that, after treatment and possible replacement with carbon dioxide, contains the same amount of carbon dioxide that it had as it emerged from the source. Sparkling bottled waters may be labeled as “sparkling drinking water,” “sparkling mineral water,” “sparkling spring water,” etc.  
- **Artesian Water/Artesian Well Water**: Bottled water from a well that taps a confined aquifer (a water-bearing underground layer of rock or sand) in which the water level stands at some height above the top of the aquifer.  
- **Well Water**: Bottled water from a hole bored, drilled, or otherwise constructed in the ground which taps the water aquifer.

---

**Regulations**  
Each bottle of water begins with a carefully selected well or municipal water source. The water is initially processed using a multi-step filtration process depending on the source. Next, the water is purified using a reverse osmosis or distillation system, and then it is disinfected with ozone just prior to bottling.  

Alkaline products are made using a similar process; however, there is an additional electrolysis step to increase the pH. Both alkaline and purified with minerals added products have one additional step, just after the water is disinfected with ozone, it is re-mineralized. We use just the right combination of minerals to give the product a smooth and refreshing taste.

**Ubicación de Niagara**  
Niagara Bottling utiliza tecnologías avanzadas de purificación, filtrado y desinfección para producir productos seguros y refrescantes para el disfrute de nuestros clientes. Niagara Bottling se complace en presentarle este informe de calidad del agua.

---

**Antecedentes**  
Todo comenzó en 1963 cuando Andrew Peykoff Sr. comenzó a embotellar agua Niagara de alta calidad y bajo costo en envases de 5 galones para entrega en hogares y oficinas. Con su insuperable ética de trabajo, integridad y servicio al cliente, Niagara pronto se convirtió en un nombre conocido en el Sur de California. La base de clientes se expandió velozmente y Niagara comenzó a proveer agua envasada en porciones individuales de marca blanca a tiendas, almacenes y clubes, así como a clientes mayoristas, siempre conservando los valores de una empresa familiar.

En las siguientes décadas, Niagara realizó avances significativos en gran velocidad de elaboración y diseño innovador de botellas; con razón hoy Niagara es considerada la mayor empresa de propiedad y operación familiar de agua envasada de los Estados Unidos. La empresa cuenta en la actualidad con 49 plantas de elaboración y continúa creciendo bajo la dirección de su nuevo CEO, Andy Peykoff II.

---

**Misión**  
La misión de Niagara es ser el principal proveedor nacional de agua envasada, ofreciendo a nuestros clientes calidad, precio y servicio sin igual. Podremos lograrlo por la búsqueda incesante de tecnología de última generación, integración vertical y mejora continua de las eficacias de los procesos. Finalmente, sólo es posible lograr nuestra misión a través de nuestra ventaja competitiva más importante: nuestra gente. El trabajo arduo, la integridad y dedicación de cada miembro del equipo de Niagara darán forma al éxito futuro de nuestra compañía por muchas generaciones.

---

**Iniciativas de Sostenibilidad**  
**Botellas más ligeras**  
Siguiendo nuestra naturaleza innovadora, en Niagara buscamos continuamente la forma de reducir nuestra huella ambiental. Niagara fue la primera embotelladora en Norteamérica en implementar el empaque anidado (Nested-pack) libre de hojas de cartón, permitiendo el embalaje de un 17% más de paquetes por tarima, lo cual resultó en una reducción del uso de materia prima e incremento de eficiencia en transporte. Desde entonces, este diseño de empaque se ha convertido en un estándar de referencia importante en la industria.

- Para 2023, Niagara ha logrado una reducción promedio del 24% de plástico PET en nuestras botellas respecto al peso promedio de la botella de 2010. A través de esta optimización y varias otras iniciativas, Niagara:
  - De 2017 a 2023, ha logrado reducir un 32% su huella de carbono por cada galón producido.
  - Desde 2019, ha incorporado 70 MW de electricidad proveniente de energías renovables, incluyendo la energía eólica generada fuera del sitio que suministra el 100% de la electricidad en 4 plantas de producción.
  - Tiene la relación más baja entre el peso del empaque y el producto de cualquier material utilizado para una botella de agua.
  - Ha reducido en más del 70% la longitud media de transporte desde 2009, minimizando el impacto en la huella de carbono por transporte.
  - Fue la primera embotelladora de agua de Norteamérica en obtener la certificación nivel Oro de TRUE (Total Resource Use and Efficiency) de Cero Residuos en 2017, evitando que más del 95% de los residuos generados dentro de la planta terminen en un vertedero. A finales de 2023, la mitad de las plantas de la compañía han logrado certificarse con nivel Oro y una con nivel Platino.

Nuestro objetivo es continuar con la desmaterialización y optimización de nuestros procesos a través de innovaciones tecnológicas y científicas. Todo esto es posible gracias a la integración vertical de nuestro proceso, donde las botellas son formadas y llenadas en la misma línea. El control total de la calidad de nuestros procesos se mantiene gracias a la mejor tecnología disponible, y continuamente se implementan mejoras en las capacidades de proceso de nuestras plantas.

- Niagara ha conseguido que 25 plantas de manufactura en Norteamérica reciban la certificación de TRUE de Cero Residuos en niveles oro o platino, otorgada por Green Business Certification Inc. (GBCI).
- En los últimos 5 años, Niagara ha sembrado más de 5,000 pies cuadrados de espacios denominados “Microbosques” dentro del terreno de 4 plantas de manufactura en Texas, Missouri y California.
- En 2022, el corporativo de Niagara obtuvo la certificación nivel oro de LEED (Leadership in Energy and Environmental Design) para el diseño y construcción de edificios sustentables, la cual es otorgada por Green Business Certification Inc. (GBCI) y US Green Building Council (USGBC).

---

**Auditorías**  
Todas las plantas de Niagara son auditadas mensualmente por el equipo de Garantía de Calidad y anualmente por auditores externos como la Fundación Nacional de Sanidad (NSF), la FDA y la Asociación Internacional del Agua Envasada (IBWA). Adicionalmente, Niagara toma parte en auditorías regulares de clientes para asegurar conformidad con varios requisitos. Estas auditorías ayudan a asegurar que la compañía satisface las normas federales y de la industria para controles de proceso y sanidad. Durante los últimos once años, todas las plantas de Niagara han sido certificadas como Nivel 3 SQF a través de NSF o Eurofins, que es el mayor nivel de certificación que se puede obtener. La certificación SQF nivel 3 está internacionalmente reconocida por la Iniciativa Mundial de Seguridad Alimenticia (GFSI).

---

**Producción**  
Niagara utiliza equipo de alta velocidad de fabricación y cada línea de producción tiene la capacidad de producir 1200 botellas de agua por minuto. Mantener la calidad en tales altas velocidades es crítico para nuestro éxito. Es por este motivo que Niagara utiliza tecnología de última generación para realizar continuamente controles visuales durante todo el proceso de producción. Los sistemas de control visual pueden reconocer y rechazar botellas con defectos como botellas que no se llenaron por completo, tapas desalineadas, etiquetas mal alineadas y mucho más. El equipo de Garantía de Calidad también controla diversos aspectos del proceso de purificación de agua a diario para asegurarnos de estar produciendo un producto consistente y seguro. El laboratorio in-situ garantiza que los resultados se obtengan rápidamente.

---

**Operadores de Planta Certificados**  
El éxito general y la calidad de nuestro producto dependen de los conocimientos y la fuerza de nuestros miembros del equipo. Todos los miembros del equipo de Garantía de Calidad deben aprobar un examen reconocido internacionalmente sobre calidad y elaboración de agua envasada, administrado por IBWA. Toda el agua envasada por Niagara proviene de aguas municipales, de pozo y/o manantiales cuidadosamente seleccionados. Cada fuente es sometida a un ensayo cuando ingresa a nuestra planta para garantizar su conformidad con regulaciones estatales y federales. El producto luego se controla y prueba a través de los procesos de purificación y envasado para asegurarnos de seguir elaborando un producto coherentemente de alta calidad. La investigación es realizada para más de 190 atributos químicos así como características físicas y de sabor. Este nivel de prueba supera el conjunto de requisitos en el lugar por la FDA o la EPA.

---

**Nuestro Compromiso Con la Calidad**  
**Regulaciones**  
Normas de Identidad del Agua  
Dado que la industria del agua envasada está regulada por la FDA, han establecido normas de identidad para diversos tipos de agua envasada. Esto garantiza que cada tipo de agua envasada satisface las normas mínimas. A continuación, se presentan ejemplos de tipos de agua embotellada en el mercado. Niagara embotella actualmente agua manantial, agua purificada y agua purificada con minerales agregados.

- **Agua de Manantial**: Agua envasada derivada de una formación subterránea desde la cual el agua fluye naturalmente a la superficie de la tierra. El agua de manantial sólo puede ser recogida en el manantial o a través de una perforación que alcanza la formación subterránea que alimenta al manantial.
- **Agua Purificada**: Agua envasada que ha sido producida por destilación, des-ionización, ósmosis inversa u otros procesos adecuados, mientras cumplan con la definición de agua purificada de la Farmacopea de Estados Unidos. Otros nombres adecuados para el agua envasada tratada por uno de los procesos mencionados incluyen “agua destilada” si es producida por destilación, “agua des-ionizada” si es producida por des-ionización, etc.
- **Agua Mineral**: Agua envasada que contiene no menos de 250 partes por millón de sólidos disueltos totales. El agua mineral se distingue de otros tipos de agua envasada por su nivel constante y proporciones relativas de elementos minerales y trazas en el punto donde emerge de la fuente; no se pueden agregar minerales a este producto.
- **Agua Carbonatada Envasada**: Agua que, después de ser sometida a tratamiento y posible agregado de dióxido de carbono, contiene la misma cantidad de dióxido de carbono que tenía cuando emergió de la fuente. Las aguas carbonatadas envasadas pueden etiquetarse como “agua potable carbonatada”, “agua mineral carbonatada”, “agua de manantial carbonatada”, etc.
- **Agua Artesiana / Agua de Pozo Artesiano**: Agua envasada de un pozo que comunica con un acuífero cautivo (una capa subterránea con agua de piedra o arena) en el cual el nivel de agua está a cierta altura por encima de la parte superior del acuífero.
- **Agua de Pozo**: Agua envasada de un pozo, perforado o construido de otra manera en el suelo que se conecta con el acuífero.

Con su propio conjunto de requisitos de prueba y estándares de fabricación, la industria de agua embotellada es una de las más reguladas en Estados Unidos. El agua envasada está regulada por la FDA, que también es responsable por las regulaciones de las industrias alimenticia y farmacéutica. El agua del grifo, por otro lado, está regulada por la EPA. En virtud de la Ley del Agua Potable Segura (Safe Drinking Water Act), las regulaciones de la FDA para el agua envasada deben ser por lo menos tan estrictas como las Normas Primarias del Agua Potable (Primary Drinking Water Standards) de la EPA (conocidas como Niveles Máximos de Contaminantes). En general, se requiere que el agua envasada sea sometida a ensayos para los mismos parámetros que el agua del grifo, pero las normas son, en muchos casos, más estrictas que las que aplican al agua del grifo. Garantizar la seguridad del agua es nuestro objetivo principal al proveer productos de agua envasada a nuestros clientes.

Cada botella de agua comienza con una fuente de agua municipal o pozo cuidadosamente seleccionados. El agua se procesa inicialmente usando un proceso de filtrado de múltiples pasos dependiendo de la fuente. A continuación, el agua es purificada a través de un sistema de ósmosis inversa y luego es desinfectada con ozono inmediatamente antes de ser embotellada. Los productos alcalinos se fabrican mediante un proceso similar; sin embargo, hay un paso de electrólisis adicional para aumentar el pH. Tanto los productos alcalinos como los purificados con minerales añadidos tienen un paso adicional: inmediatamente después de que el agua sea desinfectada con ozono, es remineralizada. Usamos la combinación exacta de minerales para dar a los productos un sabor suave y refrescante.

---

**Agua Purificada, Destilado, Agua Purificada Con Agregado de Minerales y Alcalina**  
Proveer agua de manantial de excelente sabor empieza por encontrar la fuente de más alta calidad y mejor sabor. Todas las fuentes de manantiales deben ser sometidas a una intensa inspección antes de ser aprobadas para su utilización en los productos Niagara. Las fuentes son inspeccionadas por nuestro personal capacitado y experimentado de Garantía de Calidad que incluye microbiólogos, químicos e hidrogeólogos. Durante el proceso de inspección se examinan todos los aspectos de la fuente, incluyendo seguridad, tratamiento en la fuente, química del agua e impacto ambiental.

Una vez que se aprueba un manantial para su uso, se recoge el agua del manantial y se carga en camiones cisterna especialmente asignados, y el agua es entregada a nuestras plantas embotelladoras. El agua es probada en nuestra facilidad para asegurarse de calidad y seguridad antes del uso. Entonces es filtrada a 0.2 micras y desinfectada con ozono sólo antes de embotellar.

- Transport more water per truck load, which reduces CO₂ emissions.
- Use less plastic per bottle, which helps conserve valuable resources.

Since 2009, Niagara has reduced the carbon footprint of its bottles by 59% through innovations in design, lightweighting, and packaging. In addition, we’ve reduced our label size and bottle cap size to further reduce our material use.

*On average vs. our original 1998 500mL bottle. **Recyclable bottle and cap. Excludes label and outer wrap, which may not be recyclable in your area.

**Recycled Plastic Utilization**

Increasing our recycled content usage has driven a 12% average reduction in greenhouse gas (GHG) impact per bottle. We are currently working with a broad set of partners and government to increase the amount of recycled content available so that we can use even more!

A PET bottle provides the smallest ratio of packaging material to product while providing superior protection and safety. All of our bottles and caps are recyclable** with no BPA added.

Solar panels at our Rialto, CA facility

The solar panel systems at our Rialto, CA and San Antonio, TX plants are now operational. They provide up to 20% of the energy required and will further lower our CO2 emissions. Our Bloomfield, CT plant will also have solar power towards the end of 2022.

Four of our Texas plants have been running on 100% renewable energy since July 2021! The power comes from a local wind farm and will continue to provide 100% clean energy for the next 10 years.

Niagara leads the beverage industry in energy efficiency by:

- Utilizing industry-leading bottling equipment, laser-guided vehicles, and automatic storage and retrieval systems to reduce emissions, creating a healthy and safe environment for our Team Members.
- Using alternative energy sources like wind power and expanding our usage of solar into our operations.
- Incorporating skylights and automated lighting to decrease the energy used to power and light all of our plants.
- Reducing the energy needed to transform plastic into formed bottles.
- Implementing technologies in lighting (LED) to reduce heat loads and electricity use while creating a safer and more productive work environment.
- Managing our carbon footprint through the use of recycled plastic (rPET).

Our 0.5L bottles have an embodied carbon footprint that is 46% below the U.S. average, resulting in savings of 1.7 pounds of CO2 per pound of rPET produced.

**Providing Access to Clean Water**

Our mission of delivering high-quality water does not stop at the shelf. We demonstrate our commitment to providing access to clean drinking water through in-kind donations, volunteer service, and being there when needed most.

Natural disasters devastate communities and the environment, leaving public water systems compromised in the aftermath and unsafe by both state and federal health standards. In partnership with organizations such as Feed the Children, the American Red Cross, and Incident Action Planning, Niagara has responded to disasters such as Hurricane Harvey, the Flint Water Crisis, Hurricane Sandy, and the tsunami in Japan by providing safe, clean water to those affected by catastrophic events.

We donated over 4 million bottles of water across the various areas impacted by Hurricane Harvey and Hurricane Irma. We also partnered with Feed the Children to provide nearly 3 million bottles of water to those affected in the Flint, MI water crisis and more than 1.2 million bottles of water to communities impacted by the catastrophic floods in Louisiana.

Additionally, more than 40 of our Team Members traveled to El Jiote, Honduras, in partnership with Global Water Brigades to support the build of a new clean water system benefiting more than 560 residents.

What types of bottled water does Niagara® make?

**Purified Drinking Water:** Sourced from either deep protected wells or from municipal water supplies. This water is purified through microfiltration and reverse osmosis, which removes salts, minerals, and any suspended solids. Niagara® also incorporates ozone contact systems to disinfect their drinking water and ensure the highest quality product.

**Purified Drinking Water with Minerals Added:** Processed in the same manner as purified water, then has a defined mix of minerals added back.

**Alkaline:** Products are made using a similar process as purified drinking water with minerals added; however, there is an additional electrolysis step to increase the pH.

**Spring Water:** Water is obtained from protected spring sources approved by our quality team before being brought to our bottling facilities. We then use microfiltration and ozone to disinfect the water while ensuring that no minerals are removed.

**Distilled Water:** Water purified by reverse osmosis, then distilled to remove virtually all traces of mineral content. The water is then disinfected with ozone.

What is the shelf-life or Best By Date of my Niagara® bottled water?

The typical shelf life for each product is as follows:
- Purified Water, Purified Water with Minerals, Spring Water, and Distilled Water: 547 days.
- Alkaline: 730 days.
- Niagara® Sparkling: 270 days.

To find the specific “Best If Used By” date on your product, please refer to the date etched into the bottle, just above the label.

What minerals are in my Niagara® bottled water?

Purified and alkaline water have very small amounts of food-grade minerals added strictly for taste and have no nutritional value. Spring water mineral content is specific to the spring source and varies depending on the location of the spring. Distilled water removes all traces of mineral content through the distillation process. Check the label on your Niagara® bottled water for specific minerals that were added. You can also check out our Water Quality Report for more information regarding mineral content.

What water source is used to make Niagara® purified bottled water?

Each bottle of water begins with a carefully selected well, spring, or municipal water source. The water is initially processed using a multi-step filtration process. Next, the water is purified using a reverse osmosis or distillation system and then disinfected with ozone just prior to bottling.

What water source is used to make Niagara® spring bottled water?

Providing great tasting spring water starts with finding the best tasting, highest quality source. All spring sources undergo an intense audit and review before being selected. The sources are inspected by our trained and experienced Quality Assurance staff, which includes microbiologists, chemists, and hydrogeologists. During the inspection process, all aspects of the source are examined, including security, treatment at the source, water chemistry, and environmental impact. Once a spring is approved for use, the spring water is collected and then loaded onto dedicated water tankers and delivered to our bottling facilities. Water is tested at our facility to ensure quality and safety prior to use. It is then filtered down to 0.2 microns and disinfected with ozone just prior to bottling.

What is reverse osmosis?

Reverse osmosis is a process that removes nearly all of the salts or minerals in the source water. It works by forcing water through a semipermeable membrane at high pressure and is a very effective method for purification.

What is micron filtration?

Micron filtration removes sediment and suspended particles. These filters are designed to remove particles as small as 0.2 microns in diameter.

How is the water processed to make Niagara® bottled water?

Please view this video to learn more about our multi-step quality process.

Is there sodium in Niagara® bottled water?

For purified and distilled products, any sodium in the source water is removed in the purification process. For purified drinking water with minerals, the sodium content is approximately 1mg per 16.9 oz. Please view our Water Quality Report for more information.

Is there fluoride in Niagara® bottled water?

Fluoride is often added to municipal water supplies, but it is generally not added to bottled water products. Spring water may contain natural fluoride levels. Fluoride in the source water is removed in the purification process for all of our purified and distilled bottled water. To learn more about our water, please view our Water Quality Report.

What is the pH of my Niagara® bottled water?

Spring water, purified drinking water, and purified drinking water with minerals have a pH of less than 8.0. Alkaline water has a pH of greater than 9.0 at the time of bottling. Our bottled water samples are tested daily in each facility’s quality laboratory using calibrated pH meters. To properly test the water, we use a calibrated pH meter with an attached high purity pH probe at the time of bottling. This specialized equipment is the only way to obtain an accurate pH result from high purity waters and helps ensure that the water produced meets the strict quality specifications defined for these bottled water products. Our bottled water products typically have total dissolved solids less than 60ppm, keeping it well below the ability of a pH strip to provide an accurate reading. Litmus papers or test strips will NOT test accurately on high purity bottled water products.

Do Niagara® water bottles contain BPA?

We do not use or add BPA to any of the materials used in our bottled water containers. BPA (Bisphenol A) is a chemical building block used primarily to make polycarbonate plastic and epoxy resins. All of our bottles are produced using PET (polyethylene terephthalate) plastic and high-density polyethylene (HDPE) caps. These are food-grade plastics approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration for their use in many types of food containers.

What is the quality of my bottled water?

To learn more about our water, please view our Water Quality Report available in both English and Spanish.

Is the water used in Niagara® bottled water tested?

Our on-site testing laboratories are equipped with state-of-the-art testing machinery and staffed with degreed, experienced personnel. Comparative analyses are performed daily on products in accordance with state and federal regulatory standards. We test for organic and inorganic chemicals as regulated by the FDA and some individual states.

Is it safe to refill Niagara® water bottles or freeze them?

Our bottles are filled under sanitary conditions and are disinfected during the production process. Freezing the bottle is harmless to the product. However, as water freezes, it expands and may distort the shape of the bottle, causing instability. It may potentially expand through the cap and break the seal.

How should I store my bottled water?

The International Bottled Water Association (IBWA) advises consumers to store bottled water at room temperature or cooler, out of direct sunlight, and away from solvents and chemicals such as gasoline, paint thinners, household cleaners, and dry cleaning chemicals.

Is my Niagara® bottled water recyclable?

Our bottles and caps are 100% recyclable. Please empty and replace the cap prior to recycling. To learn more about where you can recycle your bottle, visit How2Recycle.info. (Excludes label and outer packaging, which may not be recyclable in your area.)

Why is my Niagara® bottled water flimsy and my cap smaller than other brands?

In the past 15 years, we have reduced the amount of plastic in our Eco-Air® Bottle by over 60% compared to our original 1998 500mL bottle. Because of the reduced weight in our plastic, we can transport more water per truckload, which reduces CO2 emissions, and use less plastic per bottle, helping conserve valuable resources. Since 2009, Niagara® has reduced the carbon footprint of its bottles by 59% through innovations in design, lightweighting, and packaging. In addition, we’ve reduced our label size and bottle cap size to further reduce our material use.

What is Niagara® doing to help with sustainability?

Niagara® is committed to responsible resource usage and integrating sustainability into every aspect of our business.

I want to sell Niagara® water at my store. What should I do?

For all sales inquiries, please email sales@niagarawater.com.

Should I be concerned about microplastics?

According to the FDA, there is not sufficient scientific evidence to show that microplastics and nanoplastics from plastic food packaging migrate into foods and beverages. Current scientific evidence does not demonstrate that levels of microplastics or nanoplastics found in foods pose a risk to human health. Many of the scientific studies have used methods of variable, questionable, and/or limited accuracy and specificity. Please reference this link to learn more about how the FDA keeps bottled water safe to drink.

Buyer further agrees that within three (3) calendar days from delivery of the Goods to Buyer, Buyer shall notify Seller in writing of any nonconformity, defect or problem with the Goods or any other items delivered to Buyer. Buyer agrees that Buyer’s failure to provide written notice to Seller within said time period shall constitute Buyer’s unequivocal acceptance of the Goods and agreement and acknowledgment that there is no nonconformity, defect or problem with the Goods.

6. **Security Interest**: Buyer hereby grants to Seller a security interest in the Goods sold pursuant to this Agreement to secure payment of the purchase price, delivery and shipping costs, and all other fees or amounts which are due to Seller. At Seller’s request, Buyer shall execute and pay the necessary filing fees for any financing statements including a UCC-1 statement in a form which is satisfactory to Seller. Buyer will execute all other instruments deemed necessary by Seller. Buyer further grants to Seller a security interest in and to all proceeds, increases, replacements, additions and accessions to the Goods. Seller’s security interest in the Goods sold pursuant to this Agreement shall terminate upon Buyer’s full and final payment of all sums due and owing. A copy of this Agreement may be filed with appropriate state authorities, at any time by Seller, as a financing statement in order to perfect the security interest. Until such time as Seller’s security interest in the Goods is terminated, Buyer shall use any and all means necessary to ensure that Goods sold to Buyer pursuant to this Agreement are preserved, safeguarded, and kept in their original condition free of defects or contamination. Buyer hereby agrees the security interest granted herein is in all the Buyer’s present and after-acquired property.

7. **Financing**: In the event Seller, in its sole discretion, approves of Buyer’s purchase of Goods pursuant to a credit or financing transaction, Buyer hereby represents and agrees that it shall execute the necessary financing documents including, but not limited to, a promissory note and security agreement which secures the purchase price of the Goods with all tangible and intangible assets owned by Buyer.

8. **No Offset**: Payment of the purchase and all sums due to Seller shall be made in full pursuant to the terms herein without any deduction or credit. Any deduction, credit, discount or rebate which is due to Buyer shall be remitted to Buyer by check within a reasonable time after Seller’s receipt of the full purchase price. Buyer’s failure to pay the full amount when due, without any deduction, offset or credit, shall constitute a material breach of this Agreement.

9. **Expenses**: Buyer shall be liable for and shall pay all expenses, including, but not limited to, all expenses of freight, handling, storage, and insuring. The sales prices do not include any amount for duties, or for present or future sales, excise or other similar tax which may be applicable to the sale of the Goods or the use thereof by Buyer. Buyer agrees to pay all such taxes and duties including interest and penalties thereon. If Seller is required to pay such taxes to any taxing authority, Buyer will promptly reimburse Seller within fifteen (15) days for the amount paid and such payments shall constitute secured payments for the purposes of this Agreement.

10. **Right of Access**: Until such time as Seller’s security interest in the Goods is terminated, Seller shall have the right to enter onto any of the property of Buyer to enforce its security interest in the Goods, make an inventory of the Goods, and/or to examine the condition of the Goods as well as the manner in which the Goods are stored and kept. Buyer hereby grants Seller an express right of access to the property of Buyer, and hereby agrees that in the event the Seller or its representative enters onto the property of Buyer pursuant to this Agreement, such access shall be deemed to be with the express consent of Buyer and therefore shall not constitute trespass for criminal or civil purposes. Buyer agrees that Seller shall have the right to obtain the cooperation of any governmental agency, legal enforcement agency, or other administrative agency in obtaining access to Buyer’s property as provided herein.

11. **Insurance Requirements**: Until such time as Seller’s security interest in the Goods is terminated, Buyer shall keep the Goods insured against loss by fire, theft and other causes in an amount and under a form of policy sufficient to cover all Goods then in the possession of the Buyer. Buyer shall pay all premiums or other expenses of the insurance. In case of failure to procure or maintain such insurance, Seller shall have the right but not the obligation to obtain such insurance and the amount so paid shall be immediately due and payable by Buyer to Seller as additional costs incurred.

12. **Indemnity**: Buyer agrees to defend, indemnify and hold Seller harmless from and against all claims arising out of or in any way related to this Agreement, and agrees to indemnify the Seller for any liability, loss, cost, expense, or other damage (including reasonable attorney fees) brought about by an injury or loss of any kind suffered by any person, entity or property as a result of any act, neglect, default, omission of either the Seller or Buyer or any of their agents, employees, resellers, distributors, retailers or other representatives, excluding the sole negligence or intentional misconduct of the Seller or the Seller’s employees. This provision shall survive any termination of this Agreement and/or the Seller’s security interests, as provided herein.

13. **Responsibility for Damaged Goods**: In the event the Goods received by Buyer or Buyer’s customer, reseller or otherwise are allegedly damaged, contaminated or defective in any way, Buyer shall give written notice to Seller of such alleged defect, damage or contamination within three (3) days of delivery of the Goods. In the event such notice is not given, Buyer hereby assumes full responsibility for any alleged damage, contamination, or defects relative to the Goods, and further acknowledges that Goods received pursuant to this Agreement were delivered by Seller in good and acceptable condition. In the event Buyer or Buyer’s customer, reseller or otherwise discovers any Goods which are allegedly damaged, contaminated or defective, and Buyer gives Seller notice within the specified time as set forth above, Seller shall, at Seller’s sole option and as Buyer’s exclusive remedy, either repair or replace the Goods. Buyer further agrees and understands that certain impurities are inherent in spring and/or well water, and hereby agrees to defend, indemnify and hold Seller harmless from damages, liability, loss, cost, and/or expenses related to such impurities.

14. **Return of Goods**: Unless Seller shall have authorized or permitted, in writing, the return of any Goods, Seller shall not be obligated to accept any returns, exchanges or provide any credits for any Goods or part thereof. In the event Seller, in its sole discretion, allows the return of any Goods purchased pursuant to this Agreement, Buyer shall be obligated to pay a restocking charge equal to 20% of the purchase price.

15. **Confidentiality**: Buyer acknowledges and understands that Buyer may come into possession of information or data which constitute trade secrets, know-how, confidential information or are otherwise considered to be secret of Niagara (hereinafter "Confidential Information"). In consideration of the receipt of such Confidential Information, Buyer agrees to maintain such Confidential Information in the utmost of confidence, use such Confidential Information solely in connection with the intended business relationship established hereunder and take all measures reasonable and appropriate to protect such Confidential Information. Buyer agrees to maintain the Confidential Information in confidence and shall not, nor shall it permit its employees, agents, and/or subcontractors to sell, transfer, publish, disclose, display or otherwise make accessible the documentation, or any copies thereof, or the services, in whole or in part, to any third party, or use the documentation or services for its own benefit or the benefit of others. Buyer recognizes and acknowledges that any breach or threatened breach of this Agreement by Buyer may cause Niagara irreparable harm for which monetary damages may be inadequate. Buyer agrees, therefore, that Niagara shall be entitled to an injunction or other equitable relief (with bond or other security) to restrain Buyer from such breach or threatened breach. Furthermore, should Buyer breach this Agreement and disclose Niagara’s Confidential Information to a third party who incorporates the Confidential Information into its products and/or services, Buyer understands and acknowledges that Niagara’s remedies shall be broad and include, but not limited to, an injunction or other equitable relief (with bond or other security), recover monetary damages from Buyer for the breach or threatened breach of this Agreement or seek disgorgement of any and all profits from the third party or parties who received Niagara’s Confidential Information and any other remedy at law or in equity from any breach or threatened breach of this Agreement in order to place Niagara in the position it would have been but for the breach or threatened breach of this Agreement.

16. **Solvency of Buyer**: Buyer represents that it is financially solvent and that they have the financial means to carry out their respective obligations under this Agreement. In entering into this Agreement, Seller is reasonably relying on Buyer’s representation of financial solvency in order to further conduct business relations with Buyer.

17. **Disclaimer of Express and Implied Warranties and Consequential Damages**: IN NO EVENT SHALL NIAGARA BE LIABLE FOR ANY PUNITIVE, SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES OF ANY KIND (INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO, LOSS OF PROFITS, BUSINESS REVENUES, BUSINESS INTERRUPTION AND THE LIKE), ARISING FROM OR RELATING TO THE SUPPLY OF THE GOODS, THE CONDUCT OF BUSINESS UNDER OR BREACH OF THIS AGREEMENT, ANY PURCHASE ORDER, NIAGARA’S CANCELLATION OF ANY PURCHASE ORDER OR ORDER(S), AND/OR THE TERMINATION OF BUSINESS RELATIONS WITH BUYER, REGARDLESS OF WHETHER THE CLAIM UNDER WHICH DAMAGES ARE SOUGHT IS BASED ON BREACH OF WARRANTY, BREACH OF CONTRACT, NEGLIGENCE, TORT, STRICT LIABILITY, STATUTE, REGULATION OR ANY OTHER LEGAL THEORY OR LAW, EVEN IF NIAGARA HAS BEEN ADVISED BY BUYER OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES. NIAGARA’S LIABILITY, IF ANY, SHALL BE LIMITED TO THE LESSER OF THE COST OF REPAIR OR REPLACEMENT VALUE; PROVIDED HOWEVER, THAT UNDER NO CIRCUMSTANCES WILL LIABILITY EXCEED THE AMOUNTS PAID BY BUYER TO NIAGARA UNDER THIS AGREEMENT. Niagara shall not be liable for any damages or claims caused by or which arise out of or relate to the acts or omissions of a third party.

18. **Default**: Buyer shall be in default under this Agreement on the occurrence of any of the following events or conditions: (1) Default in payment or performance of the payment terms included herein, including, without limitation, Buyer’s secured payment obligations, (2) Any warranty, representation, or statement made by or on behalf of the Buyer, either to Seller or any third party which proves to have been false in any material respect when made or furnished, (3) Death, dissolution, termination of existence, insolvency, business failure, appointment of a receiver for any part of the Goods, assignment for the benefit of creditors, or the commencement of any proceeding under any bankruptcy or insolvency law by or against the Buyer prior to termination of the Seller’s security interest, and/or (4) Failure of Buyer to provide necessary insurance and/or proof of the same as required herein.

19. **Remedies for Default**: On the occurrence of any event of default, Seller may declare all secured payments due and payable immediately and may proceed to enforce payment and exercise any and all rights and remedies provided by the California Commercial Code as well as other rights and remedies either at law or in equity possessed by Seller. Seller may require Buyer to assemble the Goods and/or make it available to Seller at any place to be designated by Seller. On the occurrence of any default, Seller shall have the right to enter onto any of the property of Buyer to regain possession of the Goods. Expenses of retaking, holding, preparing for sale, selling, or the like shall be paid by Buyer. Upon Buyer’s default, Seller may regain possession and dispose of the Goods and apply proceeds received from the sale or other disposition of the Goods to the secured payments, and to payment of attorney fees and legal expenses incurred by Seller as a result of Buyer’s default.

20. **Waiver of Default**: Seller’s acceptance of partial or delinquent payment, or the failure by Seller to exercise any right or remedy shall not be a waiver of any obligation of Buyer or right of the Seller, shall not be a modification of this Agreement or of any of Buyer’s obligations under this Agreement, and shall not constitute a waiver of any other similar default that occurs later.

21. **Choice of Law**: This Agreement (and/or any dispute arising out of or in any way related to this Agreement) shall be governed by and construed in accordance with the laws of the State of California. Any action between the Parties which arises from or is in any way related to this Agreement shall be venued in the County of San Bernardino.

22. **Private Labels and Packaging**: Notwithstanding Niagara’s assistance in designing “Private Label Goods” (i.e., any Goods carrying a trademark other than the NIAGARA trademark), Buyer shall be responsible for all label and packaging content and designs, including compliance with all applicable federal, state and local laws, regulations and ordinances (whether criminal, civil, administrative or otherwise). Such laws include, but are not limited to, those dealing with or in any way related to misbranding, adulteration, trademarks, defective or improper warnings, customs, tradenames, intellectual property of any kind, copyrights, international label compliance and/or nutritional laws. The sole exception to this is trademark and/or copyright claims arising out of or related to Buyer’s resale of goods containing the NIAGARA™ logo. Buyer represents that it has title and/or license to use any and all trademarks and any other intellectual property rights used on or in conjunction with Private Label Goods, and that it has the right to transfer such title and license to Niagara, as required herein. Buyer agrees to defend, hold harmless and indemnify Niagara for any claims, damages or losses (including reasonable attorney fees) arising out of or related to any breach of this provision. Buyer further acknowledges that in producing Private Label Goods, Niagara may, from time to time, produce overages and/or surplus and Buyer hereby grants Niagara the right and license to transfer, sell and/or dispose of any such Private Label Good overages or surplus to any third party, in its sole discretion. Buyer hereby agrees to defend and indemnify Niagara from any and all losses, claims or demands (including reasonable attorney fees) which arise from or are related to Niagara’s sale and/or distribution of Private Label Goods overages or surplus.

23. **Attorneys’ Fees**: In the event that litigation, judicial process or any other action is necessary to enforce the terms of this Agreement, the prevailing party shall be entitled to reasonable attorneys' fees and costs.

24. **Independent Review**: Each party hereto acknowledges and represents that it has fully and carefully read this Agreement and is entering into this Agreement as a free and voluntary act.

25. **Insurance**: Buyer shall obtain and maintain, at its expense for so long as Niagara shall provide goods hereunder, a policy or policies of Commercial General Liability insurance (including product and completed operations, personal and advertising injury and contractual liability coverage) covering Niagara, with a minimum of $2,000,000 per occurrence. For Buyers whose employees enter Niagara’s premises, Buyer shall also obtain and maintain, at its expense, and for so long as such employees shall conduct such operations, a policy or policies of Worker’s Compensation Insurance with statutory limits and Automobile Liability Insurance with a minimum of $2,000,000 coverage limits for each accident, including owned, non-owned and hired vehicles. Buyer agrees to add Niagara Bottling, LLC by policy endorsement as an “additional insured” on each of the above policies, excluding Buyer’s Worker’s Compensation policy.

26. **Trademark**: This Agreement provides Buyer with a limited and nonexclusive right to use the NIAGARA trademark for the sole purpose of reselling NIAGARA brand Goods. Any other use of Niagara’s trademark is hereby expressly prohibited.

27. **Food Drug and Cosmetic Act**: The Goods provided hereunder are guaranteed, as of the date of shipment, (i) to be unadulterated and/or not misbranded within the meaning of the Federal Food, Drug and Cosmetic Act, as amended (the “Act”); and (ii) not to be Goods which may not, under the provisions of section 403 or 505 of the said Act, be introduced into interstate commerce. The aforementioned warranty shall not apply to Goods that are damaged, tampered with, improperly stored, or otherwise altered subsequent to delivery. Improper storage includes, but is not limited to, storing in direct sunlight, in an environment that is above Room Temperature, or in the proximity of solvents, cleaners and/or chemicals. Room Temperature is defined by the US Pharmacopeia as being between 59-86 degrees Fahrenheit. Many countries have regulations governing sales, distribution, and/or use of Goods which may vary from U.S. requirements. Unless expressly acknowledged in writing, Niagara disclaims any warranty or guarantee that any label, packaging and/or Goods complies with international regulations. THE WARRANTIES AND REPRESENTATIONS SET FORTH HEREIN ARE IN LIEU OF ANY OTHER WARRANTY, EXPRESS, IMPLIED OR STATUTORY RESPECTING THE GOODS, INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO, ANY IMPLIED WARRANTY OF MERCHANTABILITY, QUALITY OR FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE. BUYER’S SOLE AND EXCLUSIVE REMEDY IN CONTRACT, TORT OR UNDER ANY OTHER THEORY AGAINST SELLER RESPECTING THE GOODS OR ACTIONS ARISING OUT OF THIS AGREEMENT ARE AS DESCRIBED HEREIN AND NO OTHER REMEDY (INCLUDING, WITHOUT LIMITATION, CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES) SHALL BE AVAILABLE TO BUYER. SELLER SHALL HAVE NO FURTHER OBLIGATION OR LIABILITY WITH RESPECT TO THE GOODS OR THEIR SALE AND USE, AND SELLER NEITHER ASSUMES NOR AUTHORIZES THE ASSUMPTION OF ANY OBLIGATION OR LIABILITY IN CONNECTION WITH THE GOODS. Buyer is expressly prohibited from making warranties or representations to third parties beyond what Seller has represented herein.

28. **Force Majeure**: Niagara shall not be liable in any respect and shall not be deemed to be in default of its obligations hereunder where such failures on the part of Niagara shall be caused directly or indirectly by any matter beyond the control of Niagara including, but not limited to, the following: Power outages, labor shortages, material shortages, storms, acts of God, riots, civil insurrection, floods, strikes, lockouts, epidemics, landslides, earthquakes, fires, storms, hurricanes, washouts, arrests, civil disturbances and explosions, equipment breakdowns or failures, war, and any other causes whether of the kind enumerated or otherwise beyond Niagara’s reasonable control.

29. **Miscellaneous**: This Agreement constitutes the final, complete, exclusive and entire integrated Agreement among the Parties respecting the Goods which are the subject hereof, and that any terms set forth in Buyer’s purchase order or other confirming memoranda shall be of no force or effect. Any amendment, addendum, or revision to this agreement shall be valid only if in writing and signed by the Parties. This Agreement constitutes a personal contract and the Buyer shall not transfer or assign the Agreement or any part thereof without the prior written consent of Niagara. This Agreement does not authorize the Buyer to act as the agent or legal representative of Niagara for any purpose whatsoever. Buyer is not granted any right or authority to assume or to create any obligation or responsibility, express or implied, on behalf or in the name of Niagara or to bind Niagara in any manner. The failure of either party at any time to require performance by the other party of any provision hereof shall not affect in any way the full right to require such performance at any time thereafter. Nor shall the waiver by either party of a breach of any provision hereof be taken or held to be a waiver of the provision itself. If any provision of this Agreement is held invalid or unenforceable by any court of final jurisdiction, it is the intent of the Parties that all other provisions of this Agreement be construed to remain fully valid, enforceable, and binding on the Parties. This document shall be deemed to have been mutually drafted by the parties hereto. Any ambiguity in the interpretation of this Agreement shall not be construed or interpreted against either party. Buyer acknowledges that Seller may maintain a copy of these documents in electronic form and agrees that a copy reproduced from such electronic form or by any other reliable means (for example, photocopy, image or facsimile) shall in all respects be considered equivalent to an original. Furthermore, Buyer agrees that a copy of these documents shall be admissible evidence irrespective of the best evidence rule or any other state or federal evidence rules.

**STANDARD PURCHASE TERMS AND CONDITIONS**

These Standard Purchase Terms and Conditions (the “Agreement”) control all purchases made by Niagara Bottling, LLC (“Niagara”). The supplier of goods and/or services to Niagara (“Seller”) acknowledges that the terms of this Agreement may be different from those of Seller’s quotation, invoice, proposal, confirming sales memoranda, or other documentation (“Seller Documentation”). In the event Seller demands inclusion of any terms other than those expressly set forth in this Agreement, Seller shall notify Niagara in writing within 48 hours of receipt of any associated order from Niagara. Seller will send any such notice to legalnotices@niagarawater.com and via certified mail to 1440 Bridgegate Drive, Diamond Bar, CA 91765 USA. Failure to provide Niagara with such notice shall constitute Seller’s express (1) acquiescence to and acceptance of this Agreement; (2) acknowledgment that the Agreement exclusively governs and controls the parties’ relationship; and (3) recognition that any other terms included in or appended to any Seller Documentation shall be of no force or effect and are hereby superseded by the Agreement. Niagara and Seller are each a “Party” to this Agreement and collectively the “Parties” to this Agreement. Except to the extent the face of Niagara’s ordering document specifies otherwise, the following shall be applicable and control:

1. **SCOPE OF AGREEMENT AND ORDERS.**
   a. **Scope of Agreement and Purchase Orders.** This Agreement controls any purchase order placed with Seller by Niagara (a “Purchase Order”) except to the extent the Purchase Order expressly incorporates overriding terms and conditions by reference. All goods (“Goods”) and/or services (“Services”) on a Purchase Order are subject to this Agreement. In the event Seller does not agree to the terms set forth herein, Seller may reject Niagara’s Purchase Order and refrain from selling the Goods and/or Services thereunder to Niagara.

   b. **Unilateral Contract.** In the event a court of competent jurisdiction deems that the Agreement does not constitute a valid contract, then the Agreement shall be deemed to be Niagara’s offer to enter into a unilateral contract, which Seller can accept only by performance (i.e., delivery of Goods and/or performance of Services) and subject to the terms and conditions set forth herein. No course of prior dealings between the Parties and no industry custom shall be relevant to supplement or explain any term used in the Agreement.

   c. **Purchase Order Cancellation.** Niagara shall have the right in its sole discretion to cancel a Purchase Order for any reason prior to delivery. Seller understands, acknowledges, and agrees that no fees of any nature (including, but not limited to cancellation, restocking, or otherwise) shall be applicable and hereby waives the right to recover any such fees. In the event Seller has delivered pursuant to the Purchase Order and Niagara, in its sole and absolute discretion, is dissatisfied with Seller’s performance, Niagara is entitled to reject, cancel, or provide timely revocation of acceptance of the Purchase Order without penalty by so advising Seller and shall not be liable for payment. Payment of any invoice shall not be deemed a waiver of Niagara’s right to reject, cancel, or revoke acceptance of any Goods and/or Services performed. Seller shall bear all expenses and risks of unpacking, examining, repacking, storing, holding, and/or reshipping and returning any Goods rejected (or whose acceptance is revoked) by Niagara. Timely revocation shall be one hundred eighty (180) days from delivery or discovery of non-conformance, whichever is later, or in the event that equipment is installed by Seller or a third party, one hundred eighty (180) days from the installation completion date. Subsequently, upon Niagara’s return of the Goods, and at Niagara’s option, Seller shall refund to Niagara, or Niagara may offset its refund against amounts it owes to Seller, minus any design or specialty charges. Seller agrees that Niagara’s exercise of any right or remedy provided in the Agreement does not preclude any other right or remedy, all of which are cumulative and not exclusive of any other that may be available to Niagara, whether provided by law, equity, statute, or otherwise.

   d. **Packing / Delivery.** The delivery location of the Goods and/or Services (the “Facility”) shall be as indicated on the Purchase Order. Seller shall suitably pack and clearly mark the Goods in accordance with Niagara’s instructions and deliver the Goods to the Facility within the delivery timeframe indicated on the Purchase Order. Seller shall ship all Goods transported over water using seaworthy packaging. Niagara may, in its discretion, determine Seller to be in material breach of the Agreement in the event Seller fails to conform to the packing and delivery requirements, and in such case Niagara may (i) immediately terminate the Agreement without further notice to Seller and with no further obligation or liability of Niagara, (ii) withhold any payment then due and owing to Seller, and/or (iii) pursue any and all remedies against Seller available to it in law and/or equity including all damages suffered by Niagara.

   e. **Timing.** Unless a different time period is set forth on the face of the Purchase Order: (i) all in-stock Goods shall be delivered within twenty-four (24) hours from the time of Niagara’s submission of the Purchase Order; (ii) any Services shall be performed within twenty-four (24) hours from the time of Niagara’s submission of the Purchase Order; and (iii) all not-in-stock Goods shall be delivered within three (3) days from the time of Niagara’s submission of the Purchase Order. Time is of the essence relative to all Seller obligations.

   f. **Risk of Loss / Title.** If a shipping term is not otherwise specified on the Purchase Order, the Goods are sold DDP (Incoterms 2020) the Facility. Risk of loss shall pass to Niagara upon Niagara’s acceptance of the Goods at the Facility. Title to the Goods shall pass to Niagara upon the sooner of delivery of the Goods to Niagara or Niagara’s payment for such.

   g. **Paid Stock.** Seller shall bear all risk of loss, injury, or destruction to Goods for which Niagara has paid but Seller has not delivered to Niagara (“Paid Stock”) while the Paid Stock is warehoused with Seller. Seller shall obtain and maintain insurance insuring the Paid Stock against loss, damage, or destruction due to accident, theft, fire, flood, abuse, vandalism, or other hazards commonly covered by extended coverage insurance. Seller shall grant Niagara a security interest in the Paid Stock and execute such financing statements, security documents, and other instruments as Niagara shall deem appropriate to protect Niagara’s ownership of the Paid Stock against claims of creditors of Seller or third parties. Seller agrees to indemnify, defend, and hold Niagara harmless from and against the payment of any sum of money and against any expenses whatsoever, including attorney’s fees and court costs, which Niagara may be called upon to pay or incur resulting from any loss or damage to the Goods while warehoused with Seller or resulting from a creditor’s or other third party’s claim of interest, lien, or right in or to any Paid Stock warehoused with Seller.

   h. **New Developments / Upgrades.** If Seller develops new technologies or upgrades applicable to the scope of supply and commercializes the same, Seller will act in good faith to offer them to Niagara at a fair and equitable price.

   i. **Electronic Data Interchange.** Niagara may require electronic transmission and/or receipt of data via electronic data interchange (“EDI”) formats, including but not limited to purchase order, inventory, and/or transaction data. Seller shall comply with any Niagara EDI reporting requirements at no additional cost to Niagara. Niagara requiring EDI of a particular data shall not be deemed to require all future data of the same type to be through EDI unless so specified by Niagara. Seller warrants the accuracy of any and all EDI data it provides to Niagara.

   j. **Change Control Procedure.** Niagara may at any time upon written notice to Seller revise the Services or Goods in a manner which does not materially change the scope of the Services or Goods. Niagara may also request a material change in the scope of the Services or Goods or date of performance agreed to by the Parties. Within five (5) days after receipt of such a request, Seller shall submit to Niagara a written proposal, including time and costs, to address Niagara’s requested changes. If the proposal is accepted in writing by Niagara, Seller shall perform the modified Services and provide the applicable modified Services or Goods subject to such proposal in accordance with the terms and conditions of this Agreement. The corresponding order shall be revised accordingly and mutually agreed to by the Parties.

2. **PRICING AND PAYMENT.**
   a. **Purchase Price.** All fees and charges are as stated in the applicable Purchase Order. All prices are in US Dollars unless otherwise stated on the Purchase Order. The total purchase price excludes any applicable sales or use tax for which Niagara shall be responsible but includes any other taxes and all fees, shipping costs, duties, deposits, tariffs, and other costs and charges (including without limitation any costs and fees that may be imposed by government authorities outside the U.S.) (“Seller Charges”) for which Seller shall be responsible. Seller will promptly reimburse Niagara for any Seller Charges Niagara may pay.

   b. **Pricing.** Seller warrants that the prices specified in any Purchase Order are as low as any net prices given by Seller to any other customer for goods or services of like grade and quality in like quantities, and Seller agrees that if at any time during the term of this Agreement lower net prices are quoted under similar conditions, said lower net prices shall be from that time substituted for the prices herein. Seller shall make Goods and/or Services available to Niagara at Seller’s regularly listed price unless and until Seller is no longer in business, dissolved, is legally declared insolvent, or otherwise ends its operation. This provision shall survive any termination of a Purchase Order and shall be available in the event of cancellation, dispute, or otherwise.

   c. **Seller to Pass Along Savings.** In the event of manufacturing or other cost savings for any reason, such as from reduced component or raw materials costs, fluctuating exchange rates, reduced average industry pricing, or increased purchases of Goods by Niagara, a portion of such savings shall be passed on to Niagara, and the Parties shall negotiate in good faith to determine the portion to be passed on to Niagara. If such negotiation is not successful, Niagara shall have the right to immediately terminate the Agreement without further obligation to Seller.

   d. **Invoicing / Payment Terms.** Seller will invoice Niagara electronically upon shipment of the Goods or performance of the Services. Except to the extent otherwise expressly stated in a Purchase Order, payment terms shall be 2%/15, net 60 days of Niagara’s final acceptance of the Goods or Services or receipt of undisputed invoice, whichever is later.

   e. **Overdue Payments and Disputed Amounts.** Seller shall promptly notify Niagara in writing of any overdue payments. Within twenty (20) business days from receipt of such notice (the “Cure Period”), Niagara will pay any undisputed amounts and notify Seller of any amounts that are subject to a good faith dispute. Payment of undisputed fees within the Cure Period shall be deemed paid on time. For the purposes of determining the timeliness of Niagara’s payments (including cure payments), payment shall be deemed effective on the date Niagara forwards the payment to an ACH payment processor or on the date of postmark (as printed on the payment envelope by Niagara’s electronic postal meter). In the event of a good faith dispute, Niagara may withhold all disputed sums until the Parties resolve the dispute, and such withholding shall not be deemed to constitute a breach of this Agreement.

   f. **Set-Off.** If Niagara has a claim against Seller or Seller owes Niagara for any damages, rebates, and/or credits, Niagara may deduct or set off such amounts from amounts due to Seller by Niagara.

3. **SERVICE TERMS.**
   a. **Service Levels.** Except as may otherwise be described in a Purchase Order, Seller shall maintain a 99% service level (the “Service Level”), which means that Seller completely fulfills all Purchase Orders on or before the due date 99% of the time. Seller shall be in breach if Seller fails to maintain the Service Level for any two consecutive weeks. Seller’s continued failure to meet the Service Level after notice of non-compliance from Niagara shall constitute a material breach, giving rise to Niagara’s right to terminate the Agreement, cancel all outstanding Purchase Orders, withhold any payment then due, and pursue all other available remedies and damages.

   b. **Tools / Cleanup.** Any necessary tools, tarps, ladders, rigging equipment, or the like related to the delivery of the Services shall be provided by Seller at no additional cost to Niagara. Seller shall fully clean up to Niagara’s satisfaction after work is done and shall be responsible for disposal of any and all installation and/or shipping material and any fees for disposal containers. Niagara is not responsible for any of Seller’s tools which may be left onsite.

4. **DELIVERABLES.**
   a. **Definition.** “Deliverables” means the technical information, improvements, intellectual property, computer or other apparatus programs, specifications, art, plates, negatives, equipment, processes, methods, recipes, formulae, articles of manufacture, designs, drawings, records, documentation, reports, materials, concepts, plans, inventions, discoveries or adaptations, creative works, data and other knowledge, works of authorship or other creative works, ideas, know-how, knowledge or data, written, oral or otherwise expressed, whether or not protectable under applicable patent, trademark or copyright laws, developed or acquired by Seller hereunder, or by its authorized subcontractors or agents, to be delivered or otherwise provided to Niagara, including, but not limited to, Equipment, bottles, closures, molds, and their respective designs, blow molding equipment, and other equipment.

   b. **Drawings and Inventions.** Seller agrees to provide any and all drawings, schematics, and/or technical information related to the Deliverables to Niagara upon request. Seller represents and warrants that it has taken all necessary actions to ensure that any and all Deliverables created by Seller’s agents, affiliates, and/or assigns are in fact the exclusive property of Seller or have been appropriately assigned to Seller through appropriate invention assignment agreements or any other such agreements, and that such agreements restrict any and all licensing and/or use of the Deliverables by any parties other than Niagara.

   c. **Ownership and Right to Use.** Seller hereby irrevocably and perpetually assigns to Niagara ownership of, and the entire right, title, and interest in and to, the Deliverables, including any intellectual property rights embedded in or otherwise associated with the Deliverables. Seller shall, and where applicable, will have its associates, employees, subcontractors, and agents, disclose and furnish promptly to Niagara any and all Deliverables originated or developed by Seller or by any of its associates, employees, subcontractors, or agents as a result of Services performed or Goods sold pursuant to the Agreement. Seller represents, warrants, and agrees that it has not granted and will not grant to others any right of use relative to the Deliverables, and/or any other rights inconsistent with the rights granted herein. Seller agrees to execute and deliver to Niagara any requested transfers, assignments, bills of sale, and other documents as may be required to effectuate the transfer and/or assignment of the Deliverables, and the intellectual property rights embedded in or otherwise associated with the Deliverables, and perform all lawful acts, including the giving of testimony, that might be necessary or desirable for obtaining, sustaining, reissuing, or enforcing all intellectual property rights in the United States and throughout the world for the Deliverables, including, but not limited to, copyrights, trademarks, patents, and trade secrets. In full consideration of Seller’s transfer, Niagara covenants and agrees to pay Seller’s purchase price for the Deliverables as shown on the face of the Purchase Order, without further compensation.

   d. **Third Party Claims.** Notwithstanding the provisions of Section 4 (Deliverables), Seller shall indemnify, defend, and hold harmless Niagara, its customers, resellers, and distributors and their respective directors, officers, employees, agents, successors, and assigns against and in respect of any and all losses or liabilities (including damages, costs, expenses, and reasonable attorney’s fees) that result from or relate to any claims, litigation, suit, action, investigation, or proceeding brought by or on behalf of any third party alleging that the exercise by Niagara or any authorized third party of any rights granted to Niagara hereunder, including, but not limited to, the Goods, Services, or Deliverables, infringe(s) any patent, copyright, trade secret, or other intellectual property right of any third party.

   e. **Notice of Claims.** Should Seller receive (or become aware of) any demand, service of process, notice, action, settlement, summons, complaint, or the like from or by a third party alleging that a party hereto is responsible for some injury, act, omission, breach, negligence, claim, loss, violation of law, settlement, cost, expense, obligation, liability, damage, recovery, deficiency, or otherwise, including, without limitation, interest, penalties, reasonable attorney fees, and costs that arise out of, result from, or in any way relate to the subject matter of the Purchase Order, the Agreement, or the Goods and/or Services that are subject thereto, then Seller shall immediately (but no later than five (5) business days after receipt, or becoming aware, of a third party claim) provide Niagara with written notice regarding each third party claim of which Seller is or becomes aware. Seller covenants and agrees that should Seller fail to provide Niagara with timely written notice regarding any third party claim, Seller hereby generally and expressly waives, relinquishes, and releases, and agrees to hold harmless, Niagara from and against any and all claims capable of being asserted by Seller against Niagara in connection therewith.

18. **LIMITATION OF LIABILITY.** In no event shall Niagara be liable for any punitive, exemplary, special, incidental, indirect, or consequential damages of any kind (including, but not limited to loss of profits, loss of reputation, and/or loss of current or prospective business advantage, even where such losses are characterized as direct damages) arising out of or in any way related to the relationship and/or dealings between Niagara and Seller, regardless of whether the claim under which damages are sought is based upon contract, tort, negligence, strict liability, or otherwise, and regardless of whether Niagara has been advised of the possibility of such damages at the time of contracting or otherwise. Under no circumstances (whether in tort, contract, negligence, strict liability, or otherwise) shall Niagara’s liability exceed the amounts paid to Seller by Niagara under the Agreement for the Goods or Services giving rise to the liability.

19. **TERM AND TERMINATION.**
   a. **Term.** The Term of this Agreement shall commence as of the date of a Purchase Order and continue for the duration of the rights and responsibilities under such Purchase Order and any other Purchase Order.

   b. **Termination.**
   i. **Termination for Convenience.** Niagara may terminate the Agreement or a Purchase Order in whole or in part for convenience upon thirty (30) day written notice to Seller.

   ii. **Substitute Procurement.** In the event that Niagara is able to procure the Goods from another supplier at better pricing than provided by Seller or if another supplier is better able to achieve the technical specifications required by Niagara, then Niagara may terminate the applicable Purchase Order upon thirty (30) days’ notice to Seller.

   iii. **Niagara Customer Satisfaction.** In the event that Niagara, or Niagara’s customers are dissatisfied with the Goods, Niagara may immediately terminate the applicable Purchase Order upon notice to Seller, or unilaterally adjust any volume commitments hereunder.

   iv. **Effect of Termination.** Termination of the Agreement terminates all Purchase Orders under the Agreement. Termination of one or more Purchase Orders shall have no effect on any other Purchase Orders or this Agreement. Termination by Niagara for breach of Seller’s performance obligations shall relieve Niagara of all payment obligations related to such performance, and Niagara expressly reserves all rights and remedies hereunder in such instance. In the event of Niagara’s termination for convenience, Niagara shall pay for all conforming Goods and Services subject to the termination up to the date of termination.

20. **NOTICES.** Unless otherwise provided for herein, all notices and other communications required or permitted to be given to or made upon any Party hereunder shall be in writing and shall be deemed given, if delivered personally or by certified or registered mail or air courier, on the date of such delivery to such Party or its respective successors and permitted assigns at the addresses listed in the related Purchase Order or to such other address as either Party may hereafter in writing notify the other Party. If to Niagara, the notice shall be sent to the attention of the Legal Department and include email notification to legalnotices@niagarawater.com.

21. **INSURANCE.** For as long as Seller owes any obligation to Niagara and/or any statute of limitations for any potential claim that Niagara may have against Seller remains unexpired, Seller shall maintain at its own expense, and shall require its agents, representatives, or subcontractors who may perform work associated with this Agreement to maintain, all insurance and/or bonds required by statute, law, and this Agreement with insurance limits no less than the minimum insurance requirements as described in Attachment A, attached hereto and incorporated herein by reference. For the avoidance of doubt, the insurance requirements do not serve as a limitation on Seller’s liability. Seller shall furnish Niagara with a certificate evidencing compliance with this section and providing for thirty (30) days written notice to Niagara in the event of cancellation. All certificates of insurance shall be emailed to certracking@marshmma.com and shall name Niagara Bottling, LLC and its members, parents, directors, subsidiaries, employees, agents, representatives, affiliates, and assigns as an additional insured by policy endorsement (on the Comprehensive General Liability Policy and Automobile Liability in the event Seller operates motor vehicles upon Niagara’s premises) and waive all rights of subrogation against Niagara and Niagara’s members, parents, directors, subsidiaries, employees, agents, representatives, affiliates, and assigns. For any claims relating to this Agreement, Seller’s insurance shall be deemed to be primary and not contributing to or in excess of any similar coverage purchased by Niagara. Seller hereby acknowledges that naming Niagara Bottling, LLC and its members, parents, subsidiaries, directors, employees, representatives, agents, affiliates, and assigns as an additional insured by policy endorsement is a condition precedent to payment by Niagara.

**Certificate Holder and Additional Insured Policy Endorsement:** Niagara Bottling, LLC and its members, parents, subsidiaries, directors, employees, representatives, agents, affiliates, and assigns, 1440 Bridgegate Drive, Diamond Bar, CA 91765 USA.

Notwithstanding the foregoing, the Parties expressly acknowledge that quantities, pricing, and specifications included on any Purchase Order shall control in the case of any conflict with the terms and conditions herein. In no event shall Seller terms and conditions apply to this Agreement.

This Agreement may be modified only by a written document specifically identifying this Agreement and signed by an authorized representative of each Party. THE UNITED NATIONS CONVENTION ON CONTRACTS FOR THE INTERNATIONAL SALE OF GOODS SHALL NOT APPLY TO THE AGREEMENT.

   b. **California Commercial Code.** In the event Goods (as opposed to Services) dominate a Purchase Order in terms of total compensation paid, the Agreement shall serve as a written contract for the sale of Goods pursuant to the California (or other state’s) Commercial Code and all remedies, as set forth in California’s Commercial Code, Article 2 (sale of Goods), including, but not limited to, remedies relative to defective and/or nonconforming Goods shall be available to Niagara and apply to this sale, notwithstanding anything set forth in Seller’s invoices, proposals, documentation, emails, credit applications, or other confirming sales memoranda. Seller further agrees that due to the complex nature of the Goods that may be the subject of the Agreement, Niagara shall not be deemed to have accepted the Goods (as defined in California’s Commercial Code) which are the subject hereof until it has had sufficient time to ascertain the conforming nature of the same. Notwithstanding any other provision of the Agreement, nothing herein shall be deemed to limit Niagara’s available legal or equitable remedies, regardless of whether Goods or Services dominate the Purchase Order in terms of total compensation paid.

   c. **Headings.** The titles or section headings of the various provisions of this Agreement are intended solely for convenience and ease of reference and shall not in any manner amplify, limit, modify, or otherwise be used in the interpretation of any such provisions.

   d. **No Waiver.** Niagara’s delay, failure, or partial exercise of any provision herein or waiver of any breach, right, or remedy contained in or granted by the Agreement shall not be deemed a waiver of any breach, right, or remedy unless expressly stated as such by Niagara in writing signed by an authorized representative of Niagara, and then such waiver shall be limited solely to its specific terms. No particular waiver shall be construed as a waiver of any subsequent breach or failure of the same term or condition or a waiver of any other term, condition, right, or remedy in the Agreement.

   e. **Severability.** Any provision, or portion thereof, of this Agreement that is determined by a court of competent jurisdiction to be invalid, illegal, or unenforceable in any jurisdiction shall, as to that jurisdiction only, be ineffective to the extent of such invalidity, illegality, or unenforceability, without affecting in any way the remaining provisions, or portion of such provision, hereof in such jurisdiction or rendering that or any other provision of this Agreement invalid, illegal, or unenforceable in any other jurisdiction.

   f. **Survival.** All covenants, conditions, warranties, uncompleted obligations, and indemnifications contained in this Agreement which may involve performance subsequent to any termination of this Agreement, or which cannot be ascertained or fully performed until after termination of this Agreement shall survive. Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, all obligations regarding confidentiality shall survive termination for two years, and Seller’s indemnity and insurance obligations shall survive for as long as Seller owes any obligation to Niagara and/or any statute of limitations for any potential claim that Niagara may have against Seller remains unexpired.

   g. **Interpretation.** This document shall be deemed to have been mutually drafted by the Parties hereto. Any ambiguity in the interpretation of this Agreement shall not be construed or interpreted against either party.

   h. **Dispute Resolution and Attorney’s Fees.** In the event of any dispute arising out of or related to the Agreement, inclusive of a Purchase Order, the Parties shall within thirty (30) days of such dispute meet in person to discuss potential amicable resolution of the dispute. During this time period, Niagara shall not be in breach due to nonpayment of any invoice. This provision shall not be interpreted to release, postpone, or alter any of Seller’s obligations. In the event the Parties are unable to adequately resolve any claim or dispute through dispute resolution and legal proceedings arise out of or relating to this Agreement, Niagara shall be entitled to recover all reasonable fees and expenses (including, without limitation, costs of investigation, reasonable attorneys’ fees, and litigation costs and expenses) incurred should Niagara prevail in such proceedings.

   i. **Governing Law and Venue.** This Agreement is to be governed by and interpreted in accordance with the laws of the State of California, USA without giving effect to its principles of conflict of laws.

Here is the cleaned version of the text with repeated headers/footers removed and spacing fixed:

**Corporate Disclosure in Compliance with SB657 California Transparency in Supply Chain Act**

Beginning January 1, 2012, the California Transparency in Supply Chain Act requires retailers and manufacturers above a certain size doing business in California to disclose their efforts to eradicate slavery and human trafficking in their direct supply chain.

Niagara Bottling, LLC (Niagara) believes in the importance of international and human rights standards. We prohibit any form of slavery or trafficked labor at Niagara and within our supply chain. We conduct business in compliance with our Company Values and company policies, emphasizing strong adherence to high professional and social standards regarding legal and ethical responsibility.

**Verification, Audits, and Certification**

Niagara engages in verification of its product supply chain by conducting audits of suppliers to evaluate supplier compliance with Niagara’s Supplier Code of Conduct, which strictly prohibits slavery and human trafficking. Such audits are conducted by Niagara and/or third-party auditors and may be announced or unannounced. Niagara also requires its suppliers to certify (via our standard terms & conditions) that materials incorporated into products supplied to Niagara comply with laws regarding slavery and human trafficking in the United States and in the country in which they are doing business, if applicable.

**Accountability Standards and Procedures / Training**

Niagara requires all suppliers to meet standards set forth in the Niagara Supplier Code of Conduct regarding slavery and trafficking. Any supplier who fails to meet these standards regarding slavery and trafficked labor will be subject to remedial action, up to and including termination of the business relationship.

Niagara is in the process of implementing a training program for employees who have direct responsibility for sourcing suppliers of materials originating outside of the United States. Training will include identifying signs of slavery and human trafficking, and mitigating risks in our supply chain. Any Niagara employee with knowledge of slavery or trafficked labor at Niagara or within a supplier’s organization is expected to report such information to their direct supervisor or to the anonymous Niagara Ethics Hotline.

**TÉRMINOS Y CONDICIONES ESTÁNDAR DE VENTA**

LA TOTALIDAD DE LAS VENTAS DE EMBOTELLADORA NIAGARA DE MÉXICO, S. DE R.L. DE C.V., DEPENDEN EXPRESAMENTE DE LA ESTRICTA ACEPTACIÓN DE ESTOS TÉRMINOS Y CONDICIONES POR PARTE DEL COMPRADOR.

1. **Términos y condiciones de venta.** Por el presente, Embotelladora Niagara de México, S. de R.L. de C.V., (en adelante, "Niagara" o "Vendedor") limita la aceptación de todas las órdenes de compra y/o solicitudes de compra a la estricta aceptación de los términos y condiciones por parte del Comprador de conformidad con el presente documento.

2. **Precio.** El Comprador acepta que Niagara se reserve el derecho de modificar y/o aumentar el precio de los Productos mediante notificación por escrito al Comprador. Tales cambios de precios se aplicarán a todos los pedidos que aún no hayan sido entregados (a partir del momento de la notificación) al Comprador o al agente que el Comprador nombró.

3. **Condiciones de pago.** El precio de compra de los Productos de Niagara (en adelante, "Productos") es el que se establece en las Órdenes de venta o la Factura de venta de Niagara. El pago del precio total de compra deberá efectuarse de conformidad con las condiciones de pago establecidas en la Orden o Factura de venta de Niagara. Las condiciones son Franco A Bordo (FOB, por su siglas en inglés) en punto de origen (es decir, en las instalaciones de embotellado de Niagara). El riesgo de pérdida se transmitirá al transportista al momento de la entrega de los Productos por parte de Niagara. Además del precio de compra de los Productos, el Comprador pagará todo costo relativo al envío, transporte, fletes, aparejo, entrega y/o acarreo, así como cualquier otro costo asociado con el envío y/o la entrega de los Productos adquiridos en virtud del presente Contrato. El Comprador también será responsable del costo de las Etiquetas Privadas (es decir, etiquetas de marcas que no sean NIAGARA®). Las facturas no pagadas a su vencimiento estarán sujetas a un cargo por mora equivalente al 1.5% del importe de la factura por mes, o la mayor tasa legal que podrá imputarse al Comprador, lo que sea mayor. Las condiciones de pago neto y los períodos de descuento se calcularán a partir de la fecha de la Factura (en lugar de la fecha de entrega real y/o la fecha en la que el Comprador recibe realmente la factura de Niagara). El pago del Comprador se considerará efectuado al momento de la recepción de dichos fondos por parte de Niagara. A menos que Niagara indique específicamente lo contrario por escrito, todos los precios que se ofrezcan a los clientes harán referencia a entregas de camiones llenos SOLAMENTE, y tales precios no serán válidos en el caso de "camiones mixtos". A los efectos de la presente disposición, los "Camiones mixtos" incluyen a camiones llenos que transportan productos de diferentes tamaños, productos con diferentes etiquetas, y/o productos con diferentes cierres, entre otros. En el caso de que el Comprador no cumpla estrictamente con las condiciones de pago establecidas en este documento, Niagara tendrá, como recurso no exclusivo y a su exclusiva discreción, el derecho de suspender los acuerdos financieros correspondientes previos, en su caso, y una vez que el Vendedor haya cumplido con todos los términos del acuerdo, incluidas las condiciones de pago y los límites de crédito. La posterior aceptación del pago por parte de Niagara no se considerará renuncia alguna.

4. **Entrega.** El Comprador recibirá una notificación de la entrega y fecha de llegada aproximada de los Productos solicitados; sin embargo, el Vendedor no garantiza un determinado día de entrega, y el Comprador no deberá esperar una fecha de entrega específica relativa a la compra de los Productos que son objeto de este Contrato. Ante la falta de entrega, el recurso exclusivo del Comprador será un reembolso únicamente de los importes realmente pagados por la carga que no se entregó. Las cargas demoradas no pueden ser canceladas y/o consideradas "cargas no entregadas" a menos que dicha demora supere los 30 días.

5. **Aceptación.** El Comprador se compromete a inspeccionar inmediatamente todos los Productos recibidos al momento de la entrega. Asimismo, el Comprador se compromete, dentro de los tres (3) días calendario a partir de la entrega de los Productos al Comprador, a notificar al Vendedor por escrito acerca de cualquier incumplimiento, defecto o problema relativo a los Productos o a cualquier otro artículo entregado al Comprador. El Comprador acepta que la falta de notificación por escrito de su parte al Vendedor dentro de dicho periodo constituirá la aceptación inequívoca de los Productos por parte del Comprador y el acuerdo y reconocimiento de este último de que no existe incumplimiento, defecto o problema alguno relativo a los Productos.

7. **Financiamiento.** En el caso de que el Vendedor, a su exclusiva discreción, autorice la compra de los Productos por parte del Comprador conforme a una operación de crédito o financiación, el Comprador declara y acepta por el presente que celebrará los documentos de financiamiento necesarios, incluido un pagaré y un acuerdo de garantía que asegura el precio de compra de los Productos y de todos los bienes tangibles e intangibles de propiedad del Comprador.

8. **Sin compensación.** El pago de la compra y todos los importes adeudados al Vendedor deberán realizarse en su totalidad de conformidad con los términos del presente documento sin ninguna deducción o crédito. Cualquier deducción, crédito, descuento o rebaja que se deba al Comprador se le remitirá a éste por cheque dentro de los 5 días hábiles posteriores a la recepción por parte del Vendedor del precio total de la compra. La falta de pago por parte del Comprador del importe total al momento de su vencimiento, sin deducción, compensación o crédito alguno, constituirá un incumplimiento del presente Contrato.

9. **Gastos.** El Comprador será responsable y pagará todos los gastos, incluidos, entre otros, los gastos relativos al flete, a la manipulación, al almacenamiento y al seguro, salvo que el Vendedor acuerde lo contrario por escrito. Los precios de venta no incluyen montos relativos a impuestos, o a ventas actuales o futuras, impuestos internos u otro impuesto similar que pudiera ser aplicable a la venta de los Productos o su utilización por parte del Comprador. El Comprador se compromete a pagar todos sus impuestos, incluidos los intereses y recargos que se generen en consecuencia. Si se le exige al Vendedor que pague dichos impuestos ante cualquier autoridad fiscal, el Comprador le reembolsará al Vendedor de inmediato y dentro de los quince (15) días el monto pagado. Estos pagos constituirán pagos garantizados a los efectos del presente Contrato.

10. **Requisitos de seguro.** El Comprador deberá mantener los Productos asegurados contra pérdidas por incendio, robo y otras causas en una cantidad y de conformidad con una póliza que resulte suficiente para cubrir todos los Productos que poseía el Comprador. El Comprador pagará todas las primas u otros gastos del seguro. Ante la falta de obtención o mantenimiento de dicho seguro, el Vendedor tendrá el derecho pero no la obligación de obtener ese seguro y el monto que se pague se lo deberá pagar inmediatamente el Comprador al Vendedor como costos adicionales incurridos.

11. **Indemnización.** El Comprador se compromete a indemnizar y eximir de responsabilidad al Vendedor ante cualquier reclamación que surja del presente Contrato, o se relacione con este último, y se compromete a indemnizar al Vendedor ante cualquier responsabilidad, pérdida, costo, gasto u otro tipo de daño (incluidos los honorarios de abogados) que se genere como consecuencia de una lesión o pérdida de cualquier tipo que sufra una persona, entidad o propiedad a partir de un acto, la negligencia, el incumplimiento o la omisión por parte del Vendedor o del Comprador, o de cualquiera de sus agentes, empleados, consumidores, revendedores, distribuidores, minoristas u otro tipo de representantes, sin incluir la negligencia exclusiva del Vendedor o de los empleados del Vendedor. Esta disposición prevalecerá ante cualquier tipo de extinción del presente Contrato y/o de los derechos de garantía del Vendedor, según lo dispuesto en el presente documento.

12. **Responsabilidad por daños en los Productos.** En el caso de que los Productos que reciba el Comprador o el cliente del Comprador, el revendedor u otra persona presenten algún tipo de daño, contaminación o defecto, el Comprador deberá notificar por escrito al Vendedor acerca de dicho defecto, daño o contaminación dentro de los tres (3) días posteriores a la entrega de los Productos. En el caso de que no se envíe dicha notificación, el Comprador asumirá toda la responsabilidad ante cualquier daño, contaminación o defecto en relación con los Productos y reconocerá que los Productos recibidos en virtud del presente Contrato fueron entregados por el Vendedor en buenas condiciones. En el caso de que el Comprador o el cliente del Comprador, el revendedor u otra persona descubra que los Productos presentan algún tipo de daño, contaminación o defecto, y el Comprador notifique al Vendedor dentro del tiempo especificado anteriormente, el Vendedor deberá, a su exclusiva elección y según el recurso exclusivo del Comprador, reparar o reemplazar los Productos. Asimismo, el Comprador acuerda y entiende que ciertas impurezas son inherentes al agua de manantial y/o de pozo, y se compromete por el presente a indemnizar y eximir de responsabilidad al Vendedor ante cualquier daño, responsabilidad, pérdida, costo y/o gasto relacionado con tales impurezas.

13. **Devolución de Productos.** A menos que el Vendedor haya autorizado o permitido por escrito la devolución de los Productos, el Vendedor no estará obligado a aceptar devoluciones, cambios o a proporcionar créditos por Productos o parte de los mismos. En el caso de que el Vendedor, a su exclusiva discreción, permita la devolución de cualquier Producto que se haya comprado de conformidad con lo establecido en el presente Contrato, el Comprador estará obligado a pagar un cargo de reposición equivalente al 20% del precio de compra.

14. **Confidencialidad.** El Comprador reconoce y entiende que es posible que adquiera información o datos que constituyan secretos comerciales, conocimiento (know-how), información confidencial o que Niagara considere secretos (en adelante, "Información confidencial"). En relación con la recepción de dicha Información confidencial, el Comprador se compromete a mantener dicha Información confidencial en la más absoluta confidencialidad, a utilizar dicha Información confidencial únicamente en relación con la relación comercial establecida en virtud del presente documento y a tomar las medidas necesarias para proteger dicha Información confidencial. El Comprador se compromete a mantener la Información confidencial y a no vender, transferir, publicar, divulgar, exhibir o poner a disposición la documentación, o cualquier copia de esta última, o los servicios, en su totalidad o en parte, a un tercero, ni utilizar la documentación o los servicios para su propio beneficio o en beneficio de otras personas, ni se lo permitirá a sus empleados, agentes y/o subcompradores. El Comprador reconoce y acepta que cualquier incumplimiento o amenaza de incumplimiento de este Contrato por parte del Comprador podría causarle a Niagara un daño irreparable para el cual la compensación monetaria sería adecuada. Por lo tanto, el Comprador acepta que Niagara recurra a cualquier otro tipo de recurso legal disponible que estime conveniente para evitar que el Comprador lleve a cabo dicho incumplimiento o amenaza de incumplimiento. Por otra parte, en el caso de que el Comprador no cumpla con lo establecido en este Acuerdo y divulgue la Información confidencial de Niagara a un tercero que incorpore dicha Información confidencial en sus productos y/o servicios, el Comprador entiende y reconoce que los recursos de Niagara deberán ser amplios e incluir, entre otros, la recuperación de los daños directos causados por el Comprador ante el incumplimiento o amenaza de incumplimiento de este Contrato o la solicitud de devolución de ganancias por parte del tercero o de los terceros que hayan recibido Información confidencial de Niagara y cualquier otro recurso legal ante el incumplimiento o amenaza de incumplimiento de este Contrato a los efectos de ubicar a Niagara en la posición en la que habría estado si no se hubiese llevado a cabo el incumplimiento o amenaza de incumplimiento de este Contrato.

15. **Solvencia del Comprador.** El Comprador declara que es financieramente solvente y que tiene los medios financieros para llevar a cabo sus respectivas obligaciones en virtud del presente Contrato. Al celebrar este Contrato, el Vendedor confía en la declaración de plena solvencia financiera por parte del Comprador para llevar a cabo relaciones comerciales con el Comprador y para que el Comprador cumpla plenamente con sus obligaciones en virtud del presente documento.

16. **Limitación de responsabilidad en relación con garantías expresas e implícitas y daños consecuentes.** EN NINGÚN CASO NIAGARA SERÁ RESPONSABLE ANTE DAÑOS (INCLUIDOS, ENTRE OTROS, LA PÉRDIDA DE GANANCIA, INGRESOS COMERCIALES, INTERRUPCIÓN COMERCIAL Y SIMILARES), QUE SURJAN DEL SUMINISTRO DE LOS PRODUCTOS, LA ACTIVIDAD COMERCIAL EN VIRTUD DEL PRESENTE CONTRATO O EL INCUMPLIMIENTO DE ESTE ÚLTIMO, ÓRDENES DE COMPRA, LA CANCELACIÓN DE ÓRDENES DE COMPRA POR PARTE DE NIAGARA, Y/O LA EXTINCIÓN DE LAS RELACIONES COMERCIALES CON EL COMPRADOR, INDEPENDIENTEMENTE DE QUE LA RECLAMACIÓN EN VIRTUD DE LA CUAL SE SOLICITAN DAÑOS SURJA DEL INCUMPLIMIENTO DE GARANTÍAS, EL INCUMPLIMIENTO DE CONTRATO, LA NEGLIGENCIA, LA RESPONSABILIDAD, LA LEY, LAS NORMAS O CUALQUIER OTRO TIPO DE TEORÍA LEGAL O LEY, INCLUSO SI NIAGARA HA RECIBIDO UNA NOTIFICACIÓN POR PARTE DEL COMPRADOR ACERCA DE LA POSIBILIDAD DE QUE SE PRODUZCAN TALES DAÑOS. LA RESPONSABILIDAD DE NIAGARA, EN SU CASO, ESTARÁ LIMITADA AL MENOR COSTO DEL VALOR DE REPARACIÓN O REPOSICIÓN; SIEMPRE QUE EN NINGÚN CASO LA RESPONSABILIDAD SUPERE LOS MONTOS QUE HAYA PAGADO EL COMPRADOR A NIAGARA EN VIRTUD DE ESTE CONTRATO, Y EL COMPRADOR POR EL PRESENTE RENUNCIA EXPRESAMENTE AL DERECHO DE RECLAMAR CUALQUIER RESPONSABILIDAD CUYO MONTO SEA SUPERIOR AL QUE HAYA PAGADO EL COMPRADOR A NIAGARA EN VIRTUD DE ESTE CONTRATO. Niagara no será responsable ante daños o reclamaciones que surjan de actos u omisiones por parte de un tercero, o estén relacionados con dichos actos u omisiones.

17. **Incumplimiento de pago.** El Comprador incurrirá en incumplimiento de pago en virtud del presente Contrato ante cualquiera de los siguientes acontecimientos o condiciones: 1) el incumplimiento de pago o de las condiciones de pago que se establecen en este documento, incluidas, entre otras, la obligación del pago garantizado del Comprador; 2) cualquier garantía o declaración que realice el Comprador, o una persona en su nombre, ya sea al Vendedor o a un tercero y que resulte ser falsa en cualquier aspecto en el momento en que se brinda; 3) la muerte, disolución, extinción, insolvencia, incumplimiento comercial, nombramiento de un síndico para cualquier parte de los Productos, cesión en beneficio de los acreedores o el inicio de cualquier procedimiento en virtud de cualquier ley de quiebras o insolvencia por parte del Comprador o en su contra antes de la extinción de la garantía del Vendedor; y/o 4) la falta por parte del Comprador de la contratación de un seguro necesario y/o de la presentación de prueba que lo acredite de conformidad con lo establecido en el presente documento.

18. **Recursos ante el incumplimiento de pago.** Ante un caso de incumplimiento, el Vendedor podrá declarar todos los pagos vencidos y pagaderos inmediatamente y podrá proceder a exigir el pago y a ejercer todos los derechos y recursos establecidos en las leyes de los Estados Unidos Mexicanos ("México"), así como otros derechos y recursos legales que posea el Vendedor. El Vendedor podrá exigirle al Comprador que ensamble los Productos y/o los ponga a su disposición en el lugar que el Vendedor determine. Ante el incumplimiento por parte del Comprador, el Vendedor podrá recuperar la posesión de los Productos y disponer de ellos y aplicar la ganancia obtenida a partir de la venta u otro tipo de disposición de los Productos a los pagos garantizados, y al pago de honorarios de abogados y gastos legales en los que incurra el Vendedor como consecuencia del incumplimiento por parte del Comprador.

19. **Renuncia de incumplimiento de pago.** La aceptación del Vendedor del pago parcial o moroso, o la falta de ejercicio de derechos o recursos por parte del Vendedor no constituirá la renuncia a una obligación del Comprador o a un derecho del Vendedor, no constituirá una modificación de este Contrato o de cualquiera de las obligaciones del Comprador en virtud del presente Contrato, ni constituirá una renuncia a cualquier otro tipo de incumplimiento similar que ocurra más adelante.

20. **Ley aplicable.** Este Contrato (y/o cualquier conflicto que surja del presente Contrato o se relacione con este último) se regirá e interpretará de conformidad con las leyes de México. Cualquier acción entre las Partes que surja de este Contrato, o se relacione con este último, se resolverá ante los tribunales de la Ciudad de México, Distrito Federal.

21. **Envases y Etiquetas privadas.** Sin perjuicio de la ayuda de Niagara en el diseño de “Productos con etiquetas privadas” (es decir, Productos que lleven una marca comercial que no sea la marca comercial NIAGARA), el Comprador será responsable del diseño y contenido de los envases y etiquetas, incluido el cumplimiento de todas las leyes, normas y ordenanzas municipales, estatales y federales aplicables (ya sean del ámbito penal, civil, administrativo o de otro tipo). Dichas leyes incluyen, entre otras, a aquellas leyes acerca de la falsificación de marcas, las adulteraciones, las marcas comerciales, los avisos defectuosos o inadecuados, las costumbres, los nombres comerciales, la propiedad intelectual de cualquier tipo, los derechos de autor, el cumplimiento internacional relativo a las etiquetas y/o las leyes nutricionales, o a aquellas que se relacionan de alguna manera con dichos temas. La única excepción a esto son las reclamaciones relativas a marcas comerciales y/o derechos de autor que surjan de la reventa por parte del Comprador de productos que contengan el logo de NIAGARA® o que se relacionen con dicha reventa. El Comprador declara que cuenta con el derecho y/o la licencia para utilizar las marcas comerciales y cualquier otro derecho de propiedad intelectual que se utilice en los Productos con etiquetas privadas o junto con estos últimos, y que tiene el derecho de transferir dicho derecho y licencia a Niagara, de conformidad con lo dispuesto en el presente documento. El Comprador se compromete a indemnizar y eximir de responsabilidad a Niagara ante cualquier reclamación, daño o pérdida (incluidos los honorarios de abogados) que surja del incumplimiento de esta disposición, o esté relacionado con dicho incumplimiento. En función de lo anterior, el Comprador pagará y/o reembolsará al Vendedor previa solicitud por escrito por parte de este último dentro de los 15 días posteriores a la recepción de dicha solicitud por parte del Comprador en relación con: i) los montos que el Vendedor debe pagar a un tercero o ii) cualquier reclamación civil, comercial, penal, laboral o administrativa o de cualquier otro tipo que haya iniciado cualquier persona ante el incumplimiento de esta cláusula, incluidas, entre otras, las reclamaciones que surjan del uso incorrecto de los derechos de propiedad intelectual, defectos o errores en el etiquetado o de la responsabilidad civil y/o penal por cualquier motivo. Asimismo, el Comprador reconoce que en la producción de Productos con etiquetas privadas, Niagara podrá, de manera oportuna, producir excedentes y el Comprador otorga por el presente a Niagara el derecho y la licencia para transferir, vender y/u otorgar dichos excedentes de Productos con etiquetas privadas a terceros, a su exclusiva discreción. El Comprador se compromete a indemnizar y eximir de responsabilidad a Niagara ante toda pérdida, reclamación o demanda (incluidos los honorarios de abogados) que surjan de la venta y/o distribución por parte de Niagara de los excedentes de Productos con etiquetas privadas, o que se relacionen con dicha venta y/o distribución.

22. **Honorarios de abogados.** En el caso de que sea necesario llevar a cabo una acción o proceso judicial a los efectos de exigir el cumplimiento de los términos de este Contrato, la parte ganadora tendrá derecho a los honorarios de abogados y a los costos acordados por las partes.

Para los Compradores cuyos empleados entren a las instalaciones de Niagara, el Comprador también obtendrá y mantendrá, a su costa, y por el tiempo durante el cual dichos empleados lleven a cabo ese tipo de operaciones, una póliza o pólizas que cubran “daños” en las áreas de “responsabilidad civil” y “riesgos profesionales” con plazos legales y Seguro de responsabilidad automotor con un límite de cobertura mínimo de USD 2,000,000 (o el equivalente en pesos mexicanos) por cada accidente, incluidos los vehículos tanto propios como no propios y alquilados. El Comprador acuerda añadir a Embotelladora Niagara de México, S. de R.L. de C.V. por endoso de póliza como un “asegurado adicional” en cada una de las pólizas anteriores, sin incluir la póliza que cubre los “daños” en las áreas de “responsabilidad civil” y “riesgos profesionales”.

25. **Marca comercial.** Este Contrato le otorga al Comprador el derecho limitado y no exclusivo de utilizar la marca comercial de NIAGARA con el único objetivo de revender los Productos de la marca NIAGARA. Cualquier otro uso de la marca comercial de Niagara queda expresamente prohibido.

26. **Disposiciones aplicables relativas a cosméticos, medicamentos y alimentos.** Los Productos suministrados en virtud del presente se garantizan, a partir de su fecha de envío, i) para que no sean adulterados ni presenten marcas falsas de conformidad con la Ley General de Salud; el Reglamento de Productos y Servicios y los NOMS mexicanos oficiales correspondientes. La garantía anteriormente mencionada no se aplicará a los Productos que hayan sido dañados, manipulados, almacenados de manera inadecuada o alterados con posterioridad a la entrega. El almacenamiento inadecuado incluye, entre otros casos, el almacenamiento en lugares donde de la luz solar en forma directa, en lugares con una temperatura que exceda la temperatura ambiente o en lugares que se encuentren cerca de solventes, productos de limpieza y/o productos químicos.

Salvo que se establezca expresamente por escrito, Niagara renuncia a toda garantía que establezca que una etiqueta, envase y/o Producto cumple con las regulaciones internacionales. LAS GARANTÍAS Y DECLARACIONES QUE SE ESTABLECEN EN EL PRESENTE DOCUMENTO REEMPLAZAN A CUALQUIER OTRA GARANTÍA, EXPRESA, IMPLÍCITA O LEGAL QUE SE ESTABLEZCA EN RELACIÓN CON LOS PRODUCTOS, INCLUIDAS, ENTRE OTRAS, LAS GARANTÍAS IMPLÍCITAS DE COMERCIALIZACIÓN, CALIDAD E IDONEIDAD PARA UN PROPÓSITO EN PARTICULAR. EL ÚNICO RECURSO DEL COMPRADOR POR LEY, EN VIRTUD DEL CONTRATO, O EN VIRTUD DE CUALQUIER OTRA TEORÍA CONTRA EL VENDEDOR EN RELACIÓN CON LOS PRODUCTOS O LAS ACCIONES QUE SURJAN DE ESTE CONTRATO ES EL QUE SE ESTABLECE EN ESTE DOCUMENTO Y EL COMPRADOR NO CONTARÁ CON NINGÚN OTRO RECURSO (INCLUIDOS, ENTRE OTROS, LOS DAÑOS DIRECTOS). EL VENDEDOR NO TENDRÁ OBLIGACIÓN O RESPONSABILIDAD ADICIONAL ALGUNA CON RESPECTO A LOS PRODUCTOS O A SU VENTA Y USO, Y EL VENDEDOR NO ASUMIRÁ NI AUTORIZARÁ QUE SE ASUMA OBLIGACIÓN O RESPONSABILIDAD ALGUNA EN RELACIÓN CON LOS PRODUCTOS. Se le prohíbe expresamente al Comprador otorgar garantías o representaciones a terceros que excedan lo que el Vendedor haya declarado en este documento y deberá eximir de responsabilidad al Vendedor ante cualquier reclamación por parte de terceros, investigación, auditoría o resolución emitida por cualquier tipo de autoridad, ya sea, municipal, estatal o federal, que surja del uso, manipulación, almacenamiento o distribución y entrega indebidos o irregulares de los PRODUCTOS.

27. **Fuerza mayor.** Niagara no será responsable en ningún caso y no se considerará que incurrió en incumplimiento de sus obligaciones en virtud del presente Acuerdo donde dicho incumplimiento por parte de Niagara sea causado directa o indirectamente por cualquier asunto que esté fuera del control de Niagara, incluidos los siguientes casos, entre otros: cortes de energía, escasez de mano de obra, escasez de materiales, tormentas, hechos fortuitos, disturbios, vandalismo, inundaciones, huelgas, cierres patronales, epidemias, deslizamientos de tierra, terremotos, incendios, tormentas, huracanes, erosiones, detenciones, disturbios civiles y explosiones, averías o fallos de equipos, guerras y cualquier otra causa que sea del tipo enumerado o que esté fuera del control de Niagara.

28. **Varios.** Este Contrato constituye el contrato final, completo, exclusivo e integral que celebran las Partes respecto de los Productos que son objeto del presente documento, y los términos establecidos en la orden de compra del Comprador o en otros memorandos que lo confirmen no serán válidos. Cualquier modificación, adición, o revisión de este acuerdo sólo será válida si se la realiza por escrito y la firman las Partes.

No se le otorga al Comprador ningún derecho ni autoridad para asumir o crear obligación o responsabilidad alguna, expresa o implícita, en nombre de Niagara o a los efectos de obligar a Niagara de alguna manera. La falta de exigencia de una de las partes en cualquier momento respecto del cumplimiento de las disposiciones del presente por parte de la otra parte no afectará en modo alguno el pleno derecho a exigir tal cumplimiento en cualquier momento posterior. La renuncia de una de las partes al incumplimiento de alguna disposición de este documento no se considerará como una renuncia a dicha disposición. Si alguna disposición de este Contrato es considerada inválida o inaplicable por un tribunal de jurisdicción definitiva, es la intención de las Partes que las demás disposiciones del presente Contrato se interpreten de tal manera que permanezcan plenamente válidas, exigibles y vinculantes para las Partes.

This privacy policy (the Privacy Policy) sets out our personal information collection and sharing practices for our websites and is intended to inform you of the ways in which the Websites collect personal information, the uses of that personal information, and the ways in which we will share any personal information you choose to provide to us.

Please check these policies before you submit any personal information to such third-party websites.

This Privacy Policy is intended to explain our privacy practices and covers the following areas:

We will collect and process all or some of the following personal information about you:

(a) **Information You Provide to Us**  
Personal information that you provide to us, such as when using the contact form on our websites, including your name, email address, and other contact details.

**Uses Made of Your Personal Information**

In this section, we set out the purposes for which we use personal information that we collect via our websites and, in compliance with our obligations under European law, identify the “legal grounds” on which we rely to process the information.

These “legal grounds” are set out in European Data Protection Law, which allows companies to process personal data only when the processing is permitted by the specific “legal grounds” set out in law.

Please note that in addition to the disclosures we have identified below, we may disclose personal information for the purposes we explain in this notice to service providers, contractors, agents, advisors (e.g., legal, financial, business or other advisors), and affiliates of Shepley Spring that perform activities on our behalf.

(a) **To Communicate Effectively with You and Conduct Our Business**  
To conduct our business, including to respond to your queries, to otherwise communicate with you, or to carry out our obligations arising from any agreements entered into between you and us.

(b) **Contract Performance, Legitimate Interest**  
To provide you with updates and offers, where you have chosen to receive these. We may also use your information for marketing our own and our selected business partners’ products and services to you by post, email, SMS, phone, and fax. Where required by law, we will ask for your consent at the time we collect your data to conduct any of these types of marketing. We will provide an option to unsubscribe or opt-out of further communication on any electronic marketing communication sent to you, or you may opt out by contacting us through the “GDPR Contacting Us” form.

(c) **For Research and Development Purposes**  
To analyze your personal information in order to better understand your and our other clients’ services and marketing requirements, to better understand our business, and develop our products and services.

To monitor queries and transactions to ensure service quality, compliance with procedures, and to combat fraud.

(e) **To Inform You of Changes**  
To notify you about changes to our services and products.

(g) **To Reorganize or Make Changes to Our Business**  
In the event that we: (i) are subject to negotiations for the sale of our business or part thereof to a third party; (ii) are sold to a third party; or (iii) undergo a re-organization, we may need to transfer some or all of your personal information to the relevant third party (or its advisors) as part of any due diligence process for the purpose of analyzing any proposed sale or re-organization. We may also need to transfer your personal information to that re-organized entity or third party after the sale or reorganization for them to use for the same purposes as set out in this policy.

(h) **In Connection with Legal or Regulatory Obligations**  
We may process your personal information to comply with our regulatory requirements or dialogue with regulators as applicable, which may include disclosing your personal information to third parties, the court service, and/or regulators or law enforcement agencies in connection with enquiries, proceedings, or investigations by such parties anywhere in the world or where compelled to do so. Where permitted, we will direct any such request to you or notify you before responding unless to do so would prejudice the prevention or detection of a crime.

**Transmission, Storage, and Security of Your Personal Information**

**Security Over the Internet**  
No data transmission over the Internet or website can be guaranteed to be secure from intrusion. However, we maintain commercially reasonable physical, electronic, and procedural safeguards to protect your personal information in accordance with data protection legislative requirements.

All information you provide to us is stored on our or our subcontractors’ secure servers and accessed and used subject to our security policies and standards. Where we have given you (or where you have chosen) a password which enables you to access certain parts of our websites, you are responsible for keeping this password confidential and for complying with any other security procedures that we notify you of. We ask you not to share a password with anyone.

**Export Outside the EEA**  
Your personal information may be accessed by staff or suppliers in, transferred to, and/or stored at, a destination outside the country in which you are located, whose data protection laws may be of a lower standard than those in your country. We will, in all circumstances, safeguard personal information as set out in this Privacy Policy.

Please contact us through the “GDPR Contacting Us” form below if you would like to see a copy of the specific safeguards applied to the export of your personal information.

**Storage Limits**  
Our retention periods for personal data are based on business needs and legal requirements. We retain personal data for as long as is necessary for the processing purpose(s) for which the information was collected, and any other permissible, related purpose. For example, we may retain certain transaction details and correspondence until the time limit for claims arising from the transaction has expired, or to comply with regulatory requirements regarding the retention of such data. When personal data is no longer needed, we either irreversibly anonymize the data (and we may further retain and use the anonymized information) or securely destroy the data.

**Your Rights & Contacting Us**

**Marketing**  
You have the right to ask us not to process your personal information for marketing purposes. From time to time, we will inform you if we intend to use your information for certain types of marketing activities, or if we intend to disclose your information to certain categories of third parties for such purposes. You can exercise your right to prevent such processing by not checking certain boxes on the forms we use to collect your personal information. You can also exercise the right at any time by contacting us as set out in the “GDPR Contacting Us” form below.

**Updating Information**  
We will use reasonable endeavors to ensure that your personal information is accurate. In order to assist us with this, you should notify us of any changes to the personal information that you have provided to us by contacting us as set out in the “GDPR Contacting Us” form below.

**Your Rights**  
If you have any questions in relation to our use of your personal information, you should first contact us as per the “GDPR Contacting Us” form below. Under certain conditions, you may have the right to require us to:

(a) provide you with further details on the use we make of your information;  
(b) provide you with a copy of information that you have provided to us;  
(c) update any inaccuracies in the personal information we hold;  
(d) delete any personal information that we no longer have a lawful ground to use;  
(e) where processing is based on consent, to withdraw your consent so that we stop that particular processing;  
(f) object to any processing based on the legitimate interest ground unless our reasons for undertaking that processing outweigh any prejudice to your data protection rights; and  
(g) restrict how we use your information whilst a complaint is being investigated.

Your exercise of these rights is subject to certain exemptions to safeguard the public interest (e.g., the prevention or detection of crime) and our interests (e.g., the maintenance of legal privilege). If you exercise any of these rights, we will check your entitlement and respond in most cases within a month.

If you are not satisfied with our use of your personal information or our response to any exercise of these rights, you have the right to complain.

**Contacting Us**  
If you have any questions in relation to this policy, please contact us as per the “GDPR Contacting Us” form below.

**Cookies Policy**  
We use cookies on the websites. To find out more about how we use cookies, please see our Cookies Policy.

**Changes to Our Privacy Policy and/or Cookies Policy**  
We may change the content of our websites and how we use cookies, and consequently, our Privacy Policy and our Cookies Policy may change from time to time in the future. If we change this Privacy Policy or our Cookies Policy, we will update the date it was last changed below. If these changes are material, we will indicate this clearly on our Websites.

**Annex**  
Use of personal information under EU data protection laws must be justified under one of a number of legal “grounds,” and we are required to set out the grounds in respect of each use in this policy. We note the grounds we use to justify each use of your information next to the use in the “Uses of Your Personal Information” section of this policy.

These are the principal legal grounds that justify our use of your information:

- **Consent:** Where you have consented to our use of your information (you will have been presented with a consent form in relation to any such use and may withdraw your consent by contacting us as per the “GDPR Contacting Us” form below).
- **Contract Performance:** Where your information is necessary to enter into or perform our contract with you.
- **Legal Obligation:** Where we need to use your information to comply with our legal obligations.
- **Legitimate Interest:** Where we use your information to achieve a legitimate interest and our reasons for using it outweigh any prejudice to your data protection rights.
- **Legal Claims:** Where your information is necessary for us to defend, prosecute, or make a claim against you, us, or a third party.

**California Consumer Privacy Act (CCPA)**  
On January 1, 2020, the state of California enacted the California Consumer Privacy Act (CCPA). This act further enhances existing consumer protection and privacy rights already covered by the California Online Privacy Protection Act (CalOPPA). As part of the CCPA, you are in control of your data that we hold, and you can exercise any of the following options in relation to this Personal Information (PI):

- **The Right to Disclose:** You have the right to request we disclose to you the types and sources of information collected, the reason for sharing, and the type of third party with whom data was shared.
- **The Right to Delete (or Update):** You have the right to request that we delete (or update) personal information that we hold about you, subject to regulatory exceptions (such as auditing, accounting, etc.).
- **The Right to Access:** You have the right to access information about yourself that is collected, stored, and used by us or associated third parties.

**Niagara Cares, the Arbor Day Foundation and Trees For Houston Plant 50 Trees in Baytown, Texas**

**The Volunteer Event Aims to Bring Cleaner Air and Improve Quality of Life of Local Residents**

Baytown, Texas (Oct. 17, 2024) – Today, Niagara Cares, the charitable division of Niagara Bottling, LLC, the family-run beverage company that has hydrated America since 1963, is partnering with the Arbor Day Foundation with the help of Trees For Houston to plant 50 trees at Jenkins Park in Baytown, Texas.

Located east of Houston, Baytown is growing rapidly, and the need for trees is increasing as periods of extreme heat become more frequent and severe. Niagara team members from the nearby Baytown facility helped plant the trees, which will increase tree canopy cover, aid with flood reduction, and provide shade and cooling to combat urban heat island effect for generations to come. Texas-native tree species were selected to thrive in the soil and climate of Baytown.

“We are newer to the Baytown community, and it’s important to us that we are supporting local residents in ways that enhance their quality of life, prioritize sustainability, and strengthen community connections,” said Ann Canela, director of corporate giving at Niagara Bottling. “With our goal to plant 125,000 trees in 2024, our ongoing partnership with the Arbor Day Foundation is enabling our Niagara volunteers to improve public spaces in our communities across the U.S. We are grateful to be continuing that work here in Texas.”

Niagara strongly believes in supporting the communities where they operate, championing healthy lifestyles with quality hydration since the company’s founding. This partnership and community tree planting event highlights the company’s commitment to enhancing neighborhoods and public spaces, improving local air quality, sequestering carbon from the atmosphere, and increasing canopy cover.

“It is always inspiring to partner with an organization that cultivates a culture of stewardship by inviting and encouraging colleagues to participate in creating a positive impact in their community,” said Katie Loos, president of the Arbor Day Foundation. “Thanks to Niagara Cares’ commitment to supporting healthier community environments and the hands-on efforts from their team members, the impact of this project will provide residents and park visitors with a multitude of socio-environmental benefits for years to come.”

For more than 50 years, the Arbor Day Foundation has worked to plant over 500 million trees around the world. Through a global network of partnerships, the foundation facilitates projects that empower organizations of all sizes to reach their environmental and sustainability goals via meaningful, measurable work.

Today’s tree planting marks the sixth community engagement event in 2024 between Niagara Cares and the Arbor Day Foundation and is part of their overall initiative to plant 125,000 trees across the U.S. this year. With many more volunteer events planned, this partnership is inspiring community forestry stewardship, driving positive environmental impacts, and creating healthy and vibrant spaces in communities nationwide.

For more than 60 years, we have been making a difference for our Team Members, consumers, and communities through philanthropic giving, volunteering, water donations, and disaster relief.

**Convoy of Hope Responds to Hurricane Helene and Hurricane Milton with Lifesaving Water from Niagara Bottling**

Over 2 million bottles of water have been distributed to nearly 140,000 people in the Southeast U.S.

Springfield, Mo. (Oct. 16, 2024) – Convoy of Hope, the nonprofit faith-based humanitarian and disaster relief organization, has joined forces with Niagara Cares, the charitable division of Niagara Bottling, LLC, the family-run beverage company that has hydrated America since 1963, to provide lifesaving resources in response to the devastating impacts of Hurricane Helene and Hurricane Milton on the Southeast U.S. The partnership is providing critical aid and lifesaving support to affected communities, ensuring access to clean and safe drinking water.

In response to these back-to-back storms, Convoy of Hope and Niagara have distributed over 2 million bottles of water, reaching nearly 140,000 people in 55 communities across North Carolina, South Carolina, Florida, Tennessee, Virginia, and Georgia. Niagara has also made a significant financial contribution to enhance Convoy of Hope's capacity to reach affected areas and assist those affected by both hurricanes. The two organizations remain committed to providing ongoing assistance and are actively working to support as many people as possible.

“As Convoy of Hope responds to the two storms throughout the Southeast, our partnership with Niagara is a significant asset,” said Ethan Forhetz, vice president of public engagement at Convoy of Hope. “For many individuals, access to running water is unavailable, making bottles of clean drinking water essential for survival. Thanks to incredible partners like Niagara, we are able to deliver that water to hurricane survivors in five states.”

Since 2005, Niagara Cares and Convoy of Hope have provided aid around the world in response to natural and man-made disasters such as wildfires, tornadoes, earthquakes, and hurricanes by providing safe, clean water to affected communities. Convoy of Hope awarded Niagara the 2022 Global Impact Award for their tireless and around-the-clock efforts. Niagara Cares has long been committed to uplifting and supporting communities in need, especially in times of disaster.

“Our hearts go out to the families and communities devastated by Hurricane Helene and Milton, and we are humbled to play a role in providing relief. At Niagara, we understand that access to clean and hydrating water can be the difference between life and death in times of crisis,” said Ann Canela, director of corporate giving at Niagara Bottling. “Our partnership with Convoy of Hope allows us to provide crucial support to communities in need. Together, we are not just delivering water; we are restoring hope and helping families begin the long journey of recovery.”

**Niagara Cares Announces Partnerships to Restore and Protect Vital Waterways in the West and Southwest of the U.S.**

The philanthropy of Niagara Bottling aims to restore watersheds, promote good water practices, and ensure access to clean water for generations to come.

Diamond Bar, Calif. (Oct. 9, 2024) – Niagara Cares, the philanthropy of Niagara Bottling, LLC, the family-run beverage company that has hydrated America since 1963, is partnering with key organizations to promote responsible water usage, protect water as a vital resource, and restore watersheds in the West and Southwest regions of the U.S. With the Arbor Day Foundation, the National Forest Foundation, and Colorado Water Trust, Niagara Cares will engage local team members, community members, and municipalities through volunteer efforts and initiatives to support water ecosystems.

Their work will focus on restoring the natural ecosystems feeding the Colorado River and Rio Grande, rivers that supply fresh water to multiple states and millions of people. The region is also facing ongoing environmental pressures, such as wildfires, drought, and habitat loss. From planting trees that filter runoff and protect riverbanks to restoring streams that guide water to rivers and replenish through-prone waterways, Niagara Cares is committed to safeguarding water in this region from every angle.

“At Niagara, we are dedicated to protecting water as a vital resource and creating healthy, hydrated communities,” said Ann Canela, director of corporate giving of Niagara Bottling. “These rivers are essential to multiple states in the West and Southwest, and we have partnered with experts who understand how to make meaningful improvements in these ecosystems. Our joint efforts, including planting 125,000 trees, are a meaningful step toward improving river flow and making our communities green and biodiverse for generations to come.”

Niagara Cares and the Arbor Day Foundation, the largest nonprofit membership organization dedicated to planting trees, have already begun crucial work around the Colorado River Basin to restore green spaces and protect high-risk watersheds. In 2024 alone, they have planted over 20,000 trees and shrubs across the Southwest in Missouri, and are aiming to plant an additional 125,000 trees this year. This impactful work will bring in fresh air, reduce carbon emissions, restore areas affected by wildfires, and aid in filtering stormwater runoff.

In tandem, Niagara Cares and the National Forest Foundation, a Congress-chartered organization dedicated to protecting and restoring national forests and grasslands, are partnering to restore and safeguard another watershed: the Rio Grande. This work will focus on the section that flows through Santa Fe, New Mexico, and will aim to establish restoration sites throughout northern New Mexico. Together, they will restore over 7 miles of streams, build 100 new artificial dams, and install 125 new log structures, all of which will help increase the quantity and quality of water in the Rio Grande watershed.

Niagara Cares and Colorado Water Trust, the pre-eminent environmental water expert in Colorado, are teaming up with water rights owners to direct water to ensure Colorado rivers and streams flow at healthy levels throughout the year. Due to drought and low water flow, the organizations are focusing on Slater Creek and the Crystal River, adding much-needed water to improve river habitats, support the local community, and benefit the local economy. The project, which is a partnership between Niagara Cares, Colorado Water Trust, and local ranchers in the Slater Creek watershed, will restore up to 130 million gallons of water and over 320 acre-feet of water to the creek. Earlier this year, the organizations utilized water diversion tactics to boost flows in the Crystal River resulting in over 38 million gallons of water restored and over 119 acre-feet of water added to the river.

Through these impactful partnerships, Niagara Cares is advancing its mission to protect and restore essential water sources for the benefit of both the environment and the communities that depend on them. By focusing on long-term sustainability and community engagement, Niagara reaffirms its commitment to preserving clean and hydrating water and working to ensure that future generations will continue to enjoy the vital benefits of these waterways.

Niagara Cares is the heart of what we do and how we are at Niagara Bottling. For more than 60 years, we have been making a difference for our team members, consumers, and communities through philanthropic giving, volunteering, water donations, and disaster relief.

**Niagara Cares Teams Up with Sammie’s Buddy Bench Project to Add Nearly 60 Recycled Plastic Buddy Benches to Local Communities Throughout U.S.**

With the Help of EarthX and POLYWOOD, the Organizations Will Empower Community Members to Collect HDPE #2 Plastic to Turn Into Buddy Benches for Public Spaces

Diamond Bar, Calif. (Sept. 17, 2024) – Niagara Cares, the charitable division of Niagara Bottling, LLC, the family-run beverage company that has hydrated America since 1963, is joining with Sammie's Buddy Bench Project to distribute 57 Buddy Benches to communities throughout the U.S., driving local recycling and encouraging community connections.

Together with EarthX and POLYWOOD, the Indiana brand that pioneered outdoor furniture made from recycled plastic, Niagara Cares will provide Buddy Benches made from recycled HDPE #2 plastic to communities near Niagara Bottling facilities in return for recycling 1,000 pieces of plastic.

Sammie Vance, activist, author, and student, started Sammie’s Buddy Bench Project seven years ago. Born out of the human need for connection, Sammie, age 8 at the time, learned of Buddy Benches—which encourage students to sit on the bench if they’re feeling lonely and signal other children to come and play. Since then, Sammie’s Buddy Bench Project has distributed over 500 Buddy Benches to communities across the country.

“When we learned about the kindness and community involvement that Sammie’s Buddy Bench Project promotes, we knew we had to get involved,” said Ann Canela, director of corporate giving at Niagara Bottling. “Creating healthy, vibrant community spaces and bringing people together is in our DNA as a company. By connecting people through both a recycling drive and the Buddy Benches themselves, this project will help us create positive impacts for local residents and the environment now and for generations to come. Nationwide, we’re working with our local plant teams to identify schools, parks, and other community organizations that could benefit from this impactful initiative.”

To place a Buddy Bench in their community, Niagara team members and local residents will launch a drive to collect 1,000 pieces of HDPE #2 plastic, promoting the importance of recycling. Once collected, the plastic is dropped off at a local recycling center, and the participating group will send a photo of the plastic drop-off to POLYWOOD. In return, the local group receives a Buddy Bench that will help create a more sustainable environment that is both inclusive and fosters community connection.

“I am really excited to team up with like-minded people who care about spreading kindness, recycling, and making an impact in the world! I can’t wait to see more Buddy Benches around the country because of this! We are better together,” said Sammie Vance, age 15 and founder of Sammie’s Buddy Bench Project. “You don’t have to be an adult to make a difference. You can be a kid too.”

EarthX, the environmental non-profit founded in 2010, will act as the fiscal agent for the Niagara Cares grant to supply the Buddy Benches. Founded in 1990, POLYWOOD is the first furniture company to make wood out of HDPE #2 plastic and will act as the manufacturing partner for the initiative. This zero-waste mindset and USA-made furniture brand aligns with the sustainability initiatives of Niagara.

“POLYWOOD is honored to partner with Niagara Cares and EarthX to bring Sammie’s Buddy Benches to even more schools and playgrounds across the United States,” said Doug Rassi, POLYWOOD founder and CEO. “Sammie’s commitment to the community, to recycling, and to helping kids feel less lonely is truly an inspiration to all of us at POLYWOOD.”

Once the Buddy Benches are placed, local Niagara team member volunteers will present the benches, allowing the team members to further connect with the surrounding neighborhood.

Sammie’s Buddy Bench Project was started in 2017 by Fort Wayne, IN native Sammie Vance at age 8.

Hundreds of Brigham City Families Receive Food, Water and Essential Resources from Niagara Cares, Feed the Children and Boys & Girls Club of Northern Utah

Organizations Host Resource Rally for Utah Community

Brigham City, Utah (Sept. 10, 2024) – Niagara Cares, the philanthropy of Niagara Bottling, LLC, joined today with leading anti-hunger organizations Feed the Children and Boys & Girls Club of Northern Utah for a Resource Rally where volunteers distributed food, water, daily essentials and other resources to 400 Brigham City families at 650 East 700 South.

Each pre-qualified family received a 25-pound box of food including canned vegetables, cereal, peanut butter, mac and cheese, and a case of water; a 15-pound box of personal-care essentials such as shampoo, razors, toothpaste and feminine hygiene products; and additional products.

As part of the Niagara Cares Innovation Grant, additional wrap-around community services were provided by local organizations. With many contributing factors to food insecurity, the following services will remove barriers and provide resources for childcare, employment, healthy living and more. Partners include Box Elder Family Support Center, Healthy Choice Utah, United Way of Northern Utah, Department of Workforce Services, Department of Health & Human Services, Bear River Head Start, New Hope Crisis Center, Bear River Health Department, Brigham City Fire Department, Brigham City Police Department and Boys & Girls Club Child Care.

“Connecting with and supporting our communities is central to our mission at Niagara,” said Ann Canela, director of Niagara Cares at Niagara Bottling. “Our Team Member volunteers are an integral part of this community, and it deeply moves us to offer Brigham City families these essential items. At our previous Resource Rallies, we’ve seen the significant impact these events have on everyone involved, which is why we have committed more to provide additional community services. We are grateful to be able to support families in Brigham City, and we’re committed to continuing our partnership with the Boys & Girls Club of Northern Utah to create a lasting, positive impact for generations to come.”

With one in five children in the U.S. experiencing food insecurity, hunger remains a serious issue in many communities, especially during the summer months and the back-to-school season. More than 9% of Brigham City residents live below the poverty line (according to the U.S. Census Bureau), and price hikes in transportation, food, clothing, housing and energy are stretching the budgets of families to the breaking point.

Feed the Children believes it takes everyone – the nonprofit sector, corporations, community organizations, government officials and food suppliers – to come together to do good for those who need it. When efforts are combined, a greater impact is achieved.

“Children cannot thrive unless their basic needs are met,” said Travis Arnold, president and CEO of Feed the Children. “A widespread issue like childhood hunger will only be solved when enough people work together. Partners like Niagara are vital to our mission as we serve vulnerable communities.”

Feed the Children and Niagara Cares are long-time partners, especially in providing resources in times of crisis. In 2023, the partners assisted families across America providing 11.7 million pounds of water to families impacted by crises like those in East Palestine, Ohio, Hurricane Ian, the California wildfires, and other natural disasters. Since last October, the teams have launched a series of Resource Rallies, bringing essential food, water and other supplies to families in need in California, Colorado, Georgia, Kansas and Texas, with more to come throughout the year.

Including today’s event, Niagara Cares and Feed the Children have served more than 4,400 families in communities across the nation to date. In total, the organizations have distributed over 151 million pounds of these life-saving resources to families and communities around the world during their 16-year partnership.

Niagara Cares is the heart of what we do and who we are at Niagara Bottling. For more than 60 years, we have been making a difference for our Team Members, consumers and communities through philanthropic giving, volunteering, water donations and disaster relief. As a family-owned business, we are committed to creating meaningful change for our communities through a spirit of giving back both big and small.

**Niagara Cares and the Arbor Day Foundation Partner to Increase Green Spaces Across the U.S. and Address Watershed Restoration in the Colorado River Basin**

This Arbor Day, the two organizations doubled down on their commitment to planting trees.

Diamond Bar, Calif. (April 26, 2024) – To celebrate Arbor Day, Niagara Cares, the philanthropy of Niagara Bottling, LLC, the family-run beverage company that has hydrated America since 1963, and the Arbor Day Foundation, the largest nonprofit membership organization dedicated to planting trees, announce they are teaming up to restore green spaces and protect high-risk watersheds, with a particular focus on the Colorado River Basin.

Trees filter pollutants, stimulate nutrient cycling, and prevent erosion. In 2024 alone, Niagara Cares has already planted over 20,000 trees and shrubs across the Southwest and in Missouri with the Foundation, beautifying public spaces, bringing in fresh air, and reducing carbon emissions and stormwater runoff.

“At Niagara, we believe in creating vibrant, healthy communities,” said Ann Canela, Director of Niagara Cares. “We are proud to join the Arbor Day Foundation to bring trees and shrubs to areas across the U.S., particularly in the critical Colorado River Basin. Through these projects, our volunteers can show their support for their communities as we protect watersheds, create green spaces, and foster biodiversity.”

Niagara strongly believes in supporting the communities they serve, championing healthy lifestyles with quality hydration since the company’s founding. The Southwest Reforestation Project as a whole has restored nearly 250 acres in Arizona and New Mexico. The project is projected to sequester over 4,500 tons of carbon dioxide, remove nearly 40 tons of air pollution, and avoid over 350,000 gallons of water runoff. The project also engaged local groups including K-12 students, conservation corps, and other community organizations, providing valuable learning experiences for tens of thousands of individuals.

“Trees are essential in transforming our planet by providing habitat for animals, helping to clean our air and water, and helping to lower temperatures in cities,” said Katie Loos, President of the Arbor Day Foundation. “We are proud to partner with Niagara Bottling to positively impact the American Southwest and help rebuild forests of great need.”

This Arbor Day, the Niagara Cares and the Arbor Day Foundation partnership is just getting started. In 2024, local Niagara volunteers will also help plant and distribute trees in California, Texas, Colorado, Pennsylvania, Florida, Utah, and Ohio.

Niagara Cares is the heart of what we do and who we are at Niagara Bottling. For more than 60 years, we have been making a difference for our Team Members, consumers, and communities through philanthropic giving, volunteering, water donations, and disaster relief. As a family-owned business, we are committed to creating meaningful change for our communities through a spirit of giving back both big and small.

**Niagara Cares Teams Up with Keep America Beautiful and The Recycling Partnership to Celebrate Earth Day**

Diamond Bar, Calif. (April 22, 2024) – Niagara Cares, the philanthropy of Niagara Bottling, LLC, the family-run beverage company that has hydrated America since 1963, announces two partnerships to increase recycling in honor of Earth Day. The company is teaming up with Keep America Beautiful®, a national non-profit organization inspiring action for cleaner, greener communities, envisioning a country where every community thrives, and The Recycling Partnership, a purpose-driven organization committed to advancing a circular economy by building a better recycling system. Together, they aim to educate consumers about the importance of recycling and work with local agencies to improve the collection of recyclables.

“This Earth Day, we’re doubling down on our commitment to recycling literacy and infrastructure,” said Ann Canela, Director of Niagara Cares. “Recycling leads to a circular economy, which has huge positive impacts for the environment we all share. With Keep America Beautiful and The Recycling Partnership, we’ll unite forces and bring together resources to empower individuals and communities in Texas, equipping them with the appropriate knowledge and tools needed to adopt sustainable recycling habits.”

Starting with communities in Texas, Niagara Cares and Keep America Beautiful will develop a best-in-class recycling literacy campaign to boost recyclable material collection, reaching nearly 1 million residents. The two organizations will bring in local volunteers to play a pivotal role in the project, all striving to enhance consumer trust in recycling's capacity to reduce waste, increasing the supply of post-consumer recyclables and conserving natural resources. These efforts will create a platform that can be replicated and expanded into other markets benefiting the larger economy and environment.

“Recycling is a key component of creating a cleaner, greener, and more beautiful America for everyone,” said Jennifer Lawson, President and CEO of Keep America Beautiful. “We’re pleased to be partnering with Niagara Cares on this data-driven initiative to develop strategies to increase recycling rates in Texas and in communities across the nation.”

Similar to Keep America Beautiful, Niagara and The Recycling Partnership are coming together to support further recycling initiatives in Texas, which will focus on deploying holistic recycling solutions at scale throughout the state by partnering with local governments. Through equipment investments and technical assistance, the organizations will focus on improving recycling infrastructure and performance and will measure household access, participation, and processing capacity. These efforts will be supported on the ground by The Recycling Partnership’s PET Recycling Coalition and will enhance recycling access for 50,000 households in Texas, reaching over 100,000 people.

“From our work in communities in Texas and across the U.S., we know that eight out of 10 people believe in recycling’s positive impact, but today, nearly 40% of Texans lack the ability to recycle where they live,” said Chris Wirth, Vice President of Market Development at The Recycling Partnership. “Targeted investments such as these combined with effective policy at the state and national level can increase the Lone Star State’s current 17% recycling rate by nearly 300%.”

As a result of these partnerships, residents will see a range of community workshops, educational campaigns, and infrastructure improvements to facilitate recycling access, engagement, and convenience. Through these collaborative efforts, Niagara Cares, Keep America Beautiful, and The Recycling Partnership aim to inspire lasting change and foster a culture of sustainability throughout Texas, expanding nationwide.

“Our goal at Niagara Cares is to create enduring, meaningful improvement in our communities,” Canela added. “We believe these improvements to recycling will help make lasting change for the thing that will outlive us all – the planet.”

Niagara Cares is the heart of what we do and who we are at Niagara Bottling. For more than 60 years, we have been making a difference for our Team Members, consumers, and communities through philanthropic giving, volunteering, water donations, and disaster relief. As a family-owned business, we are committed to creating meaningful change for our communities through a spirit of giving back both big and small.

**Niagara Bottling and Friends of the Los Angeles River Announce Year-Long Water Stewardship Partnership**

The Two Organizations Team Up Beginning on World Water Day to Support the LA River, Ensuring Clean Water is Top of Mind

Los Angeles (March 22, 2024) – Today, Niagara Bottling, LLC, the family-run beverage company that has hydrated America since 1963, and Friends of the LA River (FoLAR), the nonprofit organization that builds capacity for Angelenos to advocate for nature, climate, and equity on the Los Angeles River, begin a year-long partnership to bring water stewardship and community engagement to the LA River and the LA River Watershed.

The Los Angeles River is crucial to the greater LA region. It has historically provided water for and been the home of the Indigenous Gabrieleño-Tongva, Fernandeño Tataviam, Gabrieleño-Kizh, and Chumash people, played a larger role in the establishment and growth of the city of Los Angeles, and supports diverse wildlife, habitats, and local climate resilience. The two organizations will work together to enhance the River, working toward a dynamic and sustainable ecosystem that helps mitigate flood risk, cools urban temperatures, and creates more recreational opportunities for the region’s collective well-being.

“At Niagara, we strongly believe in protecting and revitalizing watersheds, not just on World Water Day, but all year round,” said Ann Canela, director of Niagara Cares, the company’s charitable organization. “With Friends of the LA River, we can directly engage the communities we serve in a way that enhances their quality of life and makes sustainability a priority. And as a Southern California-based company, we are excited to work with an organization that is having such a major impact on our region.”

This year’s grant will allow Niagara and FoLAR to host many civic events and programs including:

- **Day of Discovery Program** - 250 students in the Los Angeles region will experience a field trip with dynamic hands-on education at the LA River. This program will result in 1,000 student learning hours.

- **Source to Sea Program** - Over 50 students in the Los Angeles region will experience an LA River hands-on field trip, in-class lessons on the River’s history and biodiversity, and an interactive school visit from FoLAR’s educators. This program will result in over 375 student learning hours.

- **River Fellows Program** - Niagara is sponsoring one fellow for a full year. This is an 84-hour paid fellowship that provides equitable access to green spaces and pathways to eco-STEAM jobs for 9th-11th graders, prioritizing Title 1 schools and students adjacent to the LA River.

- **Habitat Restorations** - Over 18,000 gallons of invasive species will be removed by over 330 volunteers. Restorations include removing invasive vegetation, planting native species, and restoring acres of natural habitat.

- **Clean Up** - Over 160 volunteer hours will be dedicated to FoLAR’s annual Great LA River Clean Up, removing approximately 1,000 pounds of trash from the LA River.

- **Community Education** - Eight community education events will be hosted throughout the year to bring over 150 Angelenos to the LA River, including learning opportunities about its history, present, and future.

Since 1986, FoLAR has been on a steady path forward to improve the River, its surrounding environment, and surrounding communities, bringing over 75,000 Angelenos to the River through free and accessible programs focused on environmental education, youth eco-workforce development, monthly habitat restoration days, River Clean Ups, community education events, and policy and advocacy that prioritizes access and equity in nature.

“Meaningful and long-lasting organizational partnerships are critical to achieving FoLAR’s mission along the LA River and with LA communities. We’re excited to partner with Niagara Cares as we work toward an impactful year on the River with their support,” said Jason Schlatter, Chief Development Officer at FoLAR.

Niagara will also join FoLAR during their major milestone events of the year: FoLAR’s first-ever Earth Day Event Series, the 3rd Annual RiverFest, and the 34th Annual Great LA River Clean Up. Together, the two organizations will prioritize the LA River and make it one that residents and visitors alike respect and enjoy.

**Niagara Bottling and Wildlife Habitat Council Partner to Plant Next Microforest in Stockton, Calif.**

**Innovative Microforest Initiative Boosts Local Ecosystems and Reduces Carbon Emissions**

Stockton, Calif. (Nov. 9, 2023) - Niagara Bottling and Wildlife Habitat Council (WHC) have teamed up to plant a microforest in Stockton, Calif., creating a space dedicated to native plants to support local wildlife, capture carbon, and improve air and water quality. Importantly for this region, the plants are drought resistant and will help recharge underground aquifers. Located between two of the company’s plants in Stockton, this is the fourth microforest Niagara Bottling has planted.

Helping to restore biodiversity and bolstering the local tree population, microforests demonstrate the positive impact small-scale ecosystems have on the environment. At the Stockton site, the 600 plants there include 17 different species, which is expected to:

- Create a home for more than 500 species of insects and animals
- Reduce carbon particulate emissions by 10%
- Reduce the local temperature by 6 degrees Fahrenheit
- Sequester about 101.4 kg of CO2 per year
- Replenish more than 133,000 gallons of water per year into the aquifer through better stormwater management

“Niagara believes in supporting our communities in every way possible, including by bringing key sustainability initiatives to our plants to improve the surrounding ecosystems,” said John Cook, Sr. Director of Sustainability at Niagara. “By creating a direct benefit to the local sites and recruiting volunteers from the local teams in the design and planting, the microforest initiative demonstrates our commitment to environmental conservation, sustainability, and community engagement.”

Planting took place from Nov. 7-9 when Niagara Sustainability team members and WHC experts worked closely with the Stockton teams to bring this microforest to life, laying out the selected location, choosing plants, and recruiting volunteers to help. The finished site includes local species of trees, shrubs, and flowers such as California Buckeye, Toyon, Wild Lilac, Western Redbud, California Aster, California Buckwheat, California Wildrose, California Poppies, and many others. Once fully established, minimal maintenance will be required.

Niagara Bottling has also planted microforests in areas near facilities in Kansas City, Mo., Seguin, Texas, and Temple, Texas. In addition to the microforest initiative, Niagara leads the bottling industry in reducing materials and energy used in their products, using more renewable energy, and in achieving TRUE Zero Waste certification for many of their U.S. plants.

**Three Communities Across the U.S. Receive $75,000 Each to Improve Their Local Parks**

The National Recreation and Park Association (NRPA), the nation’s leading advocate for parks and recreation, and Niagara Bottling, the family-owned beverage company that has been hydrating America since 1963, announced the three recipients of their 2023 Perk Your Park Project grants. After a nationwide call for entries and the selection of nine finalists, community members in the greater Atlanta, San Antonio, and Los Angeles areas will each receive $75,000 to improve Fowler Field Park (Douglasville, Ga.), Max Starcke Park (Seguin, Texas), and Las Flores Park (La Verne, Calif.).

The NRPA and Niagara Bottling Perk Your Park Project empowers communities to embrace healthy lifestyles by getting residents and visitors alike to enjoy vibrant and family-oriented outdoor spaces. The grant award establishes a year-long connection between the two organizations and local municipalities, working together on project planning and bringing volunteers to help complete renovations. Since 2016, NRPA and Niagara Bottling have perked 17 parks across the United States. Through the Perk Your Park Project, they have made park dreams come true for thousands of local residents by supporting improved access to community spaces, nature, and healthy living in under-resourced communities.

“At Niagara, our dedication to enhancing the well-being of communities is deeply ingrained in the way we give back,” said Ann Canela, director of corporate giving for Niagara and head of Niagara Cares, the company’s charitable organization. “The Perk Your Park Project is an essential program that allows Niagara to revitalize these beloved green spaces, giving more children and families access to meaningful and educational parks.”

This year’s grantees have plans to improve access and make necessary upgrades, such as the addition of a rain garden, crucial storm drain system renovations, and creating more inclusive spaces with improved wheelchair accessibility and expanded sensory elements to invite all children to come play. “We are excited to continue working with Niagara to improve park and community spaces and look forward to seeing the revitalization that takes place,” said Ayanna Williams, NRPA director of community and environmental resilience. “These improvements will help build healthy, more resilient communities and we are thrilled to be a part of this important work.”

Fowler Field Park, Max Starcke Park, and Las Flores Park were selected directly from community involvement. A massive turnout of over 80,000 online submissions were counted and verified. Without the support of caring residents and neighbors, the 2023 Perk Your Park Project would not have been possible. Please visit NiagaraPerkYourPark.com for more information about the 2023 Perk Your Park Project and to view all rules, eligibility, and contest guidelines.

The National Recreation and Park Association (NRPA) is the leading not-for-profit organization dedicated to building strong, vibrant, and resilient communities through the power of parks and recreation.

**Our Focus on Sustainability**  
Niagara is committed to responsible resource usage and integrating sustainability into every aspect of our business. Niagara not only supports environmental initiatives but also innovation and leadership in our product, packaging, and manufacturing while promoting consumer awareness and action on sustainability issues. Here’s how Niagara is prioritizing sustainability:

- **Water Stewardship:** A standard Niagara facility uses less water to produce its products than it takes to keep a few golf courses green. Niagara typically pays volumetric fees for the water used and millions in taxes and fees to municipal systems that enable us to maintain and improve our infrastructure.
  
- **Packaging Efficiency:** Part of Niagara’s success is from using less plastic for our bottles than our competitors.
  
- **Minimizing Environmental Impact:** Niagara PET bottles have a lower environmental impact across most impact categories when compared to other common beverage and water packaging types. Our half-liter bottles have an embodied carbon footprint that is substantially below the U.S. average.
  
- **Recycling Infrastructure and Education:** Niagara supports recycling education through the International Bottled Water Association’s “Put it in the Bin” campaign.

Here is the cleaned version of the text with repeated headers/footers removed and spacing fixed:

---

Niagara Bottling is an American beverage manufacturer that has been family-owned and operated since 1963. Our organization is grounded by a set of principles that puts communities and sustainability first. Niagara’s roughly 425,000-square-foot Elko New Market facility will be the first in the town’s new industrial park and serve as a catalyst for long-term economic growth within the community.

**Protecting Clean Drinking Water**  
Some Minnesotans have faced difficulties with “forever chemicals” in their groundwater. Niagara’s proposal provides protections to ensure continued access to safe, clean drinking water for the Elko New Market community.

**Preserving Minnesota’s Lakes and Natural Resources**  
Niagara Bottling is complying with all environmental regulations required by Elko New Market, the State of Minnesota, and other permitting agencies to limit the facility’s impact on the local environment.

**Addressing Community Questions**  
Niagara Bottling values its partnership with the community, which is why we have had conversations with members of the community to help us understand how we can best support the residents of Elko New Market.

**Managing Traffic Flow**  
The Elko New Market facility will be the first in the town’s new industrial park, and Niagara will work alongside the City Council to ensure orderly entrances and exits that complement current traffic patterns on I-35.

**A Rich Partnership & Future**  
This proposal could mark the beginning of a rewarding relationship between the Elko New Market community and Niagara Bottling in several ways:

1. **Positioning Elko New Market as a Manufacturing Leader**  
   By accepting this proposal, Elko New Market will position itself as a leader in the bottled water manufacturing sector and secure significant opportunities for future economic growth.

2. **Creating More Well-Paying Jobs**  
   This proposal will create more than 50 well-paying full-time jobs for the local community with average annual salaries between $50,000 and $60,000 per year before overtime pay, benefits, and bonuses.

3. **Building Community Prosperity**  
   A Niagara Bottling facility in Elko New Market will inject $125 million in direct capital investment into the local community and serve as a catalyst for future community investments.

Niagara Bottling has an extensive and important presence in Stockton, manufacturing a variety of consumer beverages. Niagara’s first two manufacturing operations were located on Runway Drive and Zephyr Street in 2007 and 2014, respectively. Niagara’s newest manufacturing facilities became operational on Arch Road in 2023 and Logistics Drive in early 2024. Niagara’s overall employment in Stockton currently stands at approximately 415 full-time positions between the four plants, and it is projected to grow to an estimated 457 employees once all facilities are completed. All-in compensation (regular pay, overtime, bonuses, holidays, tuition, benefits, etc.) for all of 2023 is approximately $30 million, and projected combined payroll for all four facilities will be just over $40 million. Collectively, they are expected to generate over $1 million in annual tax revenues for the city of Stockton.

### Getting Students Ready for School
Our Stockton teams stuffed 350 backpacks with school supplies to support youth in our local communities. Through our partnership with Volunteers of America and their Northern California/Northern Nevada (NCNN) affiliate, Niagara supported their Operation Backpack program with a $10,000 grant donation. From backpacks and notepads to pencils and erasers, students in elementary, middle, and high school will soon receive the educational tools they need to succeed. UNeed2 and Women’s Center Youth & Family Services were some of the local recipients of the program, assisting more than 300 students in Stockton. Overall, the local Operation Backpack program provides over 5,000 backpacks and supplies for students across the Sacramento region. Having a brand-new backpack and supplies not only provides a child in difficult circumstances with the tools they need to succeed, it also gives them confidence and hope.

### Spreading Holiday Cheer
Our teams in Stockton worked with Volunteers of America to make “Waiting for Santa Kits” for children at their family shelter. The kits included pajamas, hot cocoa, cookies to put out for Santa, a book to read while they wait for him to come, and letters from Santa written by our Team Members. These gifts and letters from Santa provided a memorable holiday experience for the benefiting families during a difficult time in their lives.

### Shoe Drive
Our team supported a shoe drive in Elk Grove by donating two pallets of water for their event as well as setting up chairs, tables, banners, and activity stations. Some of the local organizations our Team Members regularly donate their time and resources to include:

Niagara Bottling has proposed constructing a new manufacturing facility in Tangipahoa Parish that will create local employment opportunities, drive direct capital investment in the area, and position the Parish as a manufacturing leader in the bottled beverage market. Niagara’s projected employment in Tangipahoa is expected to reach approximately 59 full-time positions with average hourly compensation ranging from $40,144 to $99,798 before overtime pay, bonuses, and benefits. Salaried positions are expected to exceed these annual averages. The total annual payroll for the plant is expected to be around $4.4 million. The initial capital investment is estimated to be up to $140-$160 million and is projected to create 165 construction jobs.

For more information about the proposal, please view our fact sheet and the Tangipahoa Regional Government FAQ.

**Who We Are**  
Niagara Bottling has been family owned and operated since 1963. Headquartered in Diamond Bar, California, Niagara operates bottling facilities throughout the U.S. and Mexico. As a leading beverage manufacturer in the U.S., Niagara Bottling works closely with some of the largest beverage brands, retailers, grocers, club, and convenience stores throughout the country. Niagara produces a variety of beverages including bottled water, sparkling, vitamin and flavored water, teas, sports drinks, ready-to-drink coffee, protein drinks, and non-dairy milk products.

**Our Commitment to Tangipahoa Parish**  
Niagara understands the community has questions about the proposal, and we want to assure you that we are committed to investing in Tangipahoa in a way that protects the area and its natural resources.

**Protecting the Tangipahoa River:**  
Niagara is committed to protecting the integrity of the Tangipahoa River. All water released from the facility will be carefully tested, including pH and pathogen level evaluation, and pre-treated as needed.

**Ensuring Extreme Weather Event Resiliency:**  
Niagara will construct its facility to ensure on-site floodplain mitigation meets or exceeds the required Louisiana state minimum and reduces the risk of standing water to the community.

**Our Commitment to Community**  
Niagara is committed to making a positive impact in our communities. As part of this commitment, our local teams regularly donate their time and resources to strengthen communities through activities and initiatives supporting education, emergency need, area beautification, the environment, and health and wellness. Niagara partners with community leaders and charitable organizations that are making a meaningful difference in the world and in the areas where our facilities are located.

**Our Focus on Sustainability**  
Niagara is committed to responsible resource stewardship and integrating sustainability into every aspect of our business. We support environmental initiatives as well as innovation and leadership in product, packaging, and manufacturing while promoting consumer awareness and action on sustainability issues. Here’s how Niagara is prioritizing sustainability:

- **Water Stewardship:** A Niagara facility uses less water to produce its products than it takes to keep a few golf courses green. Niagara pays volumetric fees for the water it uses and millions in taxes and fees to municipal systems that enable them to maintain and improve their infrastructure.

- **Packaging Efficiency:** Niagara’s Eco-Air Bottle is lightweight, recyclable, and uses 60% less plastic. In fact, our bottles are so lightweight that when you hold one you might wonder if it’s strong enough – but it is. Our recyclable Eco-Air packaging allows us to ship more water per order to reduce CO2 emissions.

- **Lowest Environmental Impact:** Since 2009, Niagara has worked to reduce the carbon footprint of its bottles by 59% through design and packaging innovations. Niagara PET bottles have a lower environmental impact across most impact categories when compared to other common beverage and water packaging types. Our 0.5L bottles have an embodied carbon footprint that is 46% below the U.S. average.

- **Recycling Infrastructure and Education:** Niagara supports recycling education through the International Bottled Water Association’s “Put it in the Bin” campaign and the “Keep the Cap On” campaign.

**Contact Our Economic Development Team**  
Our team’s mission is to promote and advance the strategic goals of the company through relationship building and engagement with public policy makers, government officials, and community leaders.

Niagara Bottling is an American beverage manufacturer that has been family-owned and operated since 1963. Our organization is grounded by a set of principles that puts communities and sustainability first. We seek to build a partnership with Tangipahoa Parish, which is why we have had conversations with local officials and members of the community to help us understand how we can best support you.

**Building a Strong Niagara-Tangipahoa Parish Partnership**

**Practicing Responsible Water Stewardship**  
We are working closely with Tangipahoa Parish Government officials, local utility providers, and expert hydrologists to ensure that this facility practices responsible water stewardship and protects the Tangipahoa River.

**Ensuring Extreme Weather Event Resiliency**  
Niagara Bottling will construct its facility to ensure its on-site floodplain mitigation provides an additional 33% floodplain storage over the area’s current capacity, plus an additional 16% retention capacity over the required state minimum.

**Addressing Community Questions**  
We understand the community has questions and even some concerns, and we want to assure you that we are committed to investing in Tangipahoa Parish in a way that protects the area’s natural resources.

**Managing Traffic Flow**  
We will collaborate with Tangipahoa Parish Government leadership to ensure that vehicles entering and exiting the Niagara Bottling manufacturing facility will complement and not complicate local traffic flow.

**A Beneficial Partnership**  
This proposal could mark the beginning of a rewarding relationship between the Tangipahoa Parish community and Niagara Bottling in several ways:

1. **Positioning Tangipahoa Parish as a Manufacturing Leader**  
   By accepting this proposal, Tangipahoa Parish will position itself as a leader in the manufacturing sector and secure significant opportunities for future economic growth.

2. **Creating More Well-Paying Jobs**  
   This proposal will create 70 well-paying, full-time jobs for the community with annual salaries between $50,000 and $60,000 per year before overtime pay, benefits, and bonuses.

3. **Building Community Prosperity**  
   A Niagara Bottling facility in Tangipahoa Parish will inject $160 million in direct capital investment into the area, and the roughly 400,000–500,000 ft² manufacturing facility will serve as a catalyst for long-term economic growth for the Parish.

Hereinafter, “Broker” and “Carrier” shall collectively be referred to as “Carrier.” “Lanes” shall mean movement of a load from Niagara’s facility to Niagara’s customer’s facility, as specified by Niagara. “Load” shall mean a single truckload. “Transportation Services” shall mean motor carrier services provided by Carrier for the transport, hauling or delivery of any commodity, including finished products, pallets, or Loads. “Award” shall mean document from Niagara to Carrier, signed by Carrier notifying Carrier of any Lane or Load awarded to Carrier, and Carrier’s acceptance of such an award. “Party” or “Parties” shall mean Niagara or Carrier individually or collectively.

**Pricing.** During the term as set forth by Niagara in its sole discretion, as described in any Award or agreement, Carrier agrees only to charge the rates set forth by Niagara (“Base Rate”) for the Transportation Services in Lanes and/or Loads as requested by Niagara as full and complete compensation for the Transportation Services being provided by Carrier. Should Niagara provide an Award to Carrier for additional Lanes and/or Loads to provide Transportation Services to, such additional Award will be subject to these Standard Carrier T&C’s.

**Payment Terms.** Prior to commencement of Transportation Services, and in order to receive payment from Niagara, Carrier must provide Niagara with a Certificate of Insurance (COI) in accordance with Section 16 herein. Carrier shall only invoice Niagara for awarded Lanes and/or Loads received from Niagara. Such invoice and all supporting documents shall be submitted promptly, following transport of any Load to Niagara via email at truckingbackup@niagarawater.com. Such invoices must include Carrier’s name and invoice number in the subject line. Each email shall only include one (1) invoice per email submission.

Niagara shall have no liability for invoices that are not received within ninety (90) days of transport of any Load. Niagara shall have no liability for added, balance due, accessorial or any other charges of any nature which are not provided by the Award and which are not submitted within ninety (90) days from date of transport of a Load. Carrier agrees to apply payment to the amount due for the specified invoice regardless of whether there are earlier unpaid invoices. In the event any payment becomes overdue, Carrier shall provide written notice to nonpayment via certified mail to: Attn: Vice President of Legal Affairs, Niagara Bottling, LLC, 2560 E. Philadelphia Street, Ontario, California 91761. Carrier shall also notify Niagara by sending emails to the following: Debra Morrison at dmorrison@niagarawater.com and transprocurement@niagarawater.com.

Such damages include, but are not limited to, costs incurred by Niagara in excess of the Base Rate to secure delivery of any Loads described in such tender offer by a third party carrier. Should Niagara subsequently offer tenders for Loads not included in the Award or agreement and Carrier agrees to transport such Loads, Carrier agrees to transport such Load at the same rates as the delivery of Loads in the Award unless otherwise agreed to in writing by the Parties. Carrier must notify Niagara within ninety (90) minutes of receipt of Niagara’s tender offer that Carrier has: (a) received the tender offer; and (b) confirm that it will transport the Load.

**Carrier Performance.** Carrier understands that all Transportation Services must be performed in a timely fashion. Carrier is solely responsible for scheduling and complying with any and all deliveries and delivery times as requested by Niagara’s customers.  
a) **Pick-up of Loads.** Carrier shall maintain a monthly on-time pick up appointment rate of a minimum of 90% from the designated Niagara facility through the entire term of the Award. If Carrier’s monthly pick-up rate falls below 90%, Carrier agrees to a $50 fee for every late pick-up appointment for the previous month that caused Carrier to fall below the 90% pick-up rate.  
b) **Delivery of Loads.** Carrier shall maintain a 98% monthly rate for on-time delivery of Loads through the entire term of the Award. On-time delivery of Loads shall mean Loads delivered within thirty (30) minutes of a scheduled delivery appointment time. If Carrier’s monthly on-time delivery rate to Niagara or its customer’s locations falls below 98%, Carrier agrees to a $100 fee for every late and/or missed delivery appointment for the previous month that caused Carrier to fall below the 98% delivery rate.  
c) **Payload:** Carrier warrants that it has the ability to ship Loads that are 45,600 pounds or less. Niagara may scale and weigh all Loads and shall provide a pallet count for all Loads. In accepting any Load, Carrier agrees to count all pallet quantities prior to sealing the trailer. Niagara will make its best effort to produce a tactical forecast of the projected volume of Loads and weights for the upcoming month. In the event Niagara requests Carrier to haul 20% more of its projected daily volume, Carrier shall comply with such a request. In the event Carrier is unable to haul Niagara’s scale and weighted Load, causing Niagara to remove any products or pallets, Carrier agrees that Niagara may deduct a fee of $100 per occurrence from Carrier’s corresponding purchase order.  
d) **Equipment.** Carrier shall ensure that all equipment used in connection with performing Transportation Services be clean, odor-free, dry, leak-proof, and free of contamination and/or infestation. Carrier warrants that no motor vehicle, trailer, tractor or other equipment that will be used for Transportation Services for Niagara has been used to transport refuse, garbage, trash or solid or liquid waste of any kind, or any types of hazardous materials.

Niagara may, at its sole discretion, reject any and all trailers for issues including, but not limited to, odors, debris from prior shipment, or lack of structural integrity. Carriers shall not be permitted more than a 1% trailer rejection rate per month.  
e) **Operation.** Carrier shall ensure and bear all costs and expenses related to the operation of its motor vehicles, trailers, tractors and equipment (“Carrier Equipment”), including ensuring that only fully qualified and licensed personnel operate any Carrier Equipment in accordance to, or as required by all applicable local, state and/or federal laws, regulations and authorities.  
f) **Customer Service.** Carrier, at its sole expense, must maintain and make available a telephone line for customer service to Niagara. Such customer service line will be operational twenty-four hours a day, seven days a week, and shall respond within thirty (30) minutes of contact by Niagara.

**Documentation.** With respect to the following documents, Carrier agrees to maintain the documents as follows:  
a) **Daily reports:** Carrier shall provide Niagara daily reports regarding the status of all Loads and delivery times;  
b) **Proof of Delivery (POD):** Carrier shall provide Niagara free of charge with any and all PODs within 48-hours of delivery of any Load, and shall maintain all such PODs for at least twelve (12) months from the date of delivery, or for a period as proscribed by law;  
c) **Bill of Lading (BOL):** Carrier agrees that Niagara’s bill of lading shall be considered: (i) an acceptable form of receipt hereunder, and (ii) specific shipping instructions. These Standard Carrier T&C’s shall be incorporated by reference into each and every such BOL and in the event of an inconsistency, these Standard Carrier T&C’s shall control; and  
d) **Supporting documents for Accessorial charges:** Carrier agrees to provide all documents in accordance with Section 18 of these Standard Terms and Conditions.

**Carrier Failure to provide Proof of Delivery (POD).** In the event Carrier fails to provide a POD within 48 hours of delivery, Niagara shall have the right to deduct all amounts paid for Transportation Services, or demand payment for the amount of the Transportation Service invoice. Additionally, if Carrier cannot provide the POD within fourteen (14) days of delivery, Niagara may charge Carrier for the cost of any of Niagara’s customer’s invoice for product not paid. Alternatively, if Niagara receives a refusal to pay for a Load from its customer, Niagara will provide Carrier with evidence of customer refusal and proof of loss, and shall charge Carrier the cost of customer’s invoice for product.

**Assignment and Subcontracting.** Carrier agrees not to interline, use other motor carriers or brokers, or to use “substituted services” or otherwise assign or subcontract any portion of any Award, agreement or purchase order without the express written consent of Niagara. If, with the express written permission of Niagara, Carrier elects to use a delivery agent or subcontract the transportation of a Load, Carrier shall be the sole bearer of any costs associated with the delivery agent or subcontractor and agrees to be fully liable for any loss, damage, or delay to transportation of any such Loads while in this third party carrier’s care, custody and/or control. Carrier understands and agrees that all payments made by Niagara are conditioned upon Niagara’s receipt of a conditional waiver and release executed by Carrier and an unconditional waiver and release executed by each Additional Party. Carrier agrees to defend, indemnify and hold Niagara and its customers harmless from any and all claims of any Additional Party for payment. Carrier acknowledges and agrees that Carrier shall remain, at all times, fully liable for all Additional Parties. Carrier warrants that it shall ensure that Additional Parties comply with and adhere to all warranties, representations, obligations, terms and conditions contained herein.

**Compliance with Law.** At all times during the Award or agreement term or its relationship with Niagara, Carrier shall comply with all applicable state and federal laws. Additionally, Carrier shall operate all Carrier Equipment in compliance with industry standards, and shall maintain and operate the same such that Carrier’s safety rating does not fall below “satisfactory” under the Federal Motor Carrier Safety Administration standards. In the event that Carrier’s safety rating falls below a “satisfactory”, Carrier shall notify Niagara immediately, and Niagara will have the immediate right to terminate any Award, agreement or purchase order upon notice to Carrier.

**Indemnification:**  
a) Carrier agrees to indemnify, defend, and hold Niagara, its affiliates, and representatives harmless from and against any and all claims arising out of or related to any Award, agreement, or purchase order and/or Transportation Services that are the subject thereof, including but not limited to: (i) any bodily injury or property damage claims, and any liability, loss, cost, expense, or other damages (including reasonable attorney fees) brought about by any injury of any kind suffered by any person or property as a result of any act, neglect, default, omission of either the Carrier, Carrier’s agents, employees, affiliates, subcontractors, or any third party for whose actions Carrier is responsible (“Carrier Actors”), or Niagara, Niagara’s agents, employees, affiliates, subcontractors or other representatives; (ii) any negligent act, misfeasance, or nonfeasance by Carrier, or Carrier Actors; (iii) any harm, injury, damage, or loss arising out of or in connection with the Transportation Services provided; (iv) third party consumer claims, suits, and/or demands, including costs and expenses of investigation and settlement and attorneys’ fees and expenses, to the extent such claims arise from: (a) any act or omission by Carrier or Carrier Actors relating to or affecting the condition, quality, or character of any Goods or Services provided; or (b) trademark, copyright, trade dress, or patent infringement. Carrier acknowledges and agrees that Carrier must receive Niagara’s express written approval prior to settling any claim or lawsuit. Niagara reserves the right at any time to control its own defense.  
b) Should Carrier receive (or become aware of) any demand, service of process, notice, action, settlement, summons, complaint or the like from or by a third party alleging that a Party hereto is responsible for some injury, act, omission, breach, negligence, claim, loss, violation of law, settlement, cost, expense, obligation, liability, damage, recovery, deficiency or otherwise, including, without limitation, interest, penalties, reasonable attorney fees and costs (each, a “Claim”) that arises out of, results from, or in any way relates to the subject matter of these Standard Terms and Conditions, an Award, agreement or purchase order, then Carrier shall immediately (but no later than five (5) business days after receipt, or becoming aware, of a third party Claim) provide Niagara with written notice regarding each third party Claim of which Carrier is or becomes aware. Carrier covenants and agrees that should Carrier fail to provide Niagara with timely written notice regarding any third party Claim, Carrier hereby generally and expressly waives, relinquishes and releases, and agrees to hold harmless, Niagara from and against any and all Claims capable of being asserted by Carrier against Niagara in connection therewith.  
c) In the event Carrier utilizes any party (“Additional Party”) regardless of that party’s legal designation of contractor, subcontractor, materials supplier, agent, or otherwise, for the purpose of performing any Transportation Services, Carrier shall submit to Niagara written notice of (i) each Additional Party, (ii) the duties each Additional Party will undertake, (iii) the amount of compensation each Additional Party is to receive from Carrier, and (iv) Carrier’s compensation schedule and payment terms with the Additional Party. Carrier understands submitting this written notice as set forth above is a condition precedent to payment. Such written notice must be sent to Vice President of Legal Affairs via email and certified mail (1) panderson@niagarawater.com, (2) 2560 E. Philadelphia St., Ontario, CA 91761.  
g) **Waiver.** Niagara’s delay, failure or partial exercise of any provision herein or waiver of any breach, right or remedy contained in or granted by any Award, agreement or purchase order shall not be deemed a waiver of any breach, right or remedy unless expressly stated as such by Niagara in writing signed by an authorized representative of Niagara, and then such waiver shall be limited solely to its specific terms.

**Limitation of Liability.** In no event shall Niagara be liable for any punitive, exemplary, special, incidental, indirect or consequential damages of any kind (including, but not limited to loss of profits, loss of reputation, and/or loss of current or prospective business advantage, when where such losses are characterized as direct damages) arising out of or in any way related to the relationship and/or dealings between Niagara and Carrier regardless of whether the claim under which damages are sought is based upon contract, tort, negligence, strict liability or otherwise, and regardless of whether the parties have been advised of the possibility of such damages at the time of contracting or otherwise. Under no circumstances shall Niagara’s maximum total liability, if any, arising out of or in any way related to the relationship and/or dealings between Niagara and Carrier exceed the amounts paid and/or due to Carrier by Niagara under any relationship between the Parties, Award, agreement or purchase order.

**Liability for Loss, Damage or Delay to Loads.**  
a) Carrier agrees that in the transportation of all Loads hereunder, it shall assume, and does assume, the liability of an interstate motor carrier, as provided by 49 U.S.C. § 14706, with such liability to exist from the time of the receipt of any of said goods by Carrier until proper delivery has been made to the location specified by Niagara. The Parties expressly decline to limit the value of the property as permitted by 49 U.S.C. § 14706(c). All claims will be filed and resolved in accordance with the ICC regulations in 49 CFR Part 370.  
b) All Loads tendered to Carrier for transportation will be palletized and stretch wrapped. Carrier reserves the right to refuse to accept any Load that is not so packaged.  
c) Parties agree that each incident of transportation of product under any Award, agreement or purchase order shall be evidenced by a BOL signed by Carrier and Niagara showing the kind, quantity, value and condition of products or goods received and delivered by Carrier at the loading and unloading points respectively. Carrier’s duties and responsibilities under any Award, agreement or purchase order between the Parties for the transport of any Load evidenced by such receipt shall commence when Carrier takes possession and control of Niagara’s property or upon execution of such receipt by Niagara, whichever occurs first, and shall end when consignee/customer/buyer signs a delivery receipt and Carrier delivers Niagara’s property. Carrier shall inspect all Loads prior to accepting possession and control and shall document any evidence of damage on the BOL. If Carrier does not indicate damage on the BOL at the time of possession and immediately communicates the existence of such damage to Niagara, Carrier agrees that damage documented upon delivery presumptively occurred while the Load was in Carrier’s custody and possession.  
d) The time limit within which Niagara must file a claim for damaged or lost products or goods against Carrier shall be nine (9) months from the date of delivery or within nine (9) months of the reasonably anticipated date of delivery in the event of a complete loss. All claims shall be paid, settled or disallowed by Carrier within ninety (90) days of filing. Disallowance shall state a lawful reason for declining to accept responsibility for the claim, and shall be stated by Carrier, not its insurer. In no event shall Niagara be required to work with Carrier’s insurer directly. Niagara agrees to immediately provide written notice of claim to Carrier showing kind, quantity, value and proof of carriage as evidenced by a signed BOL.  
e) In the event of Carrier’s breach, or alleged breach, as determined solely by Niagara, of any provision in any Award, agreement or purchase order between the Parties, in addition to all other remedies in law or equity that are available to Niagara, Carrier shall be responsible for all reasonable attorneys’ fees and costs incurred by Niagara as a result of said breach or alleged breach.

**Product Loss or Damage.**  
a) **Rejected Load.** In the event the Niagara’s customer rejects the delivery of any Load due to the fault of Carrier, Carrier must return the Load to the pick-up origin designated by Niagara at no cost. In the event Niagara’s customer rejects the delivery of a Load due to no fault of the Carrier, Niagara shall pay a transportation rate equal to the rate Niagara paid Carrier to transport the Load to Niagara’s customer. Any and all rejected Loads not scheduled for redelivery must be delivered back to Niagara’s pick-up origin within five (5) days from the time/date of initial pick-up. Any Load being transported back to Niagara’s pick-up origin must be secured with either a seal or padlock and a confirmation must be sent via email to executionteam@niagarawater.com. Return charges for shorthaul clusters will be returned at half the published rate of the Load. For long haul cluster freight, return charges will not exceed the total all-in rate of the Load.  
b) **Visual Damage to Products.** 1) For damages to individual cases of product up to less than one pallet, Niagara’s customer must note the damage on the BOL, and customer or Carrier may dispose of or donate damaged cases of product. 2) For damage to one or more pallets, Niagara’s customer must note the damage on the BOL. If the Load is rejected and remains in the custody of Carrier, Carrier must immediately contact Niagara Dispatch for deposition instructions. Carrier must provide the purchase order number, date and time of single delivery, number of pallets damaged and/or refused, bottle code, any photographs, a brief description of the damage, and contact information, including contact name, phone number, email and facsimile number.  
c) **Concealed Damage to Products.** If Niagara’s customer reports concealed damage to the product, pallet and/or Load, such damage will be investigated to determine liability. If the investigation concludes that Carrier is responsible for the damage, Carrier will be notified of Niagara’s intent to file a claim and will be given the opportunity to inspect the product, pallet, or Load prior to disposition for disposal or donation.  
d) **Product Loss/Delay.** In the event Carrier is unable to execute delivery for reasons such as theft of Load, vehicular accident, or delay impacting the product’s integrity (i.e., non-delivery of Load/products to its specified destination within five (5) calendar days), recovery of loss will be executed pursuant to 49 CFR 370.  
e) **Donation/Disposal.** Due to product liability, trademark protection, and/or licensing agreements for private label stock, any distressed, damaged or otherwise rejected shipment that is not returned to a Niagara facility, for whatever reason, must be properly disposed of or donated in accordance with Niagara’s express written instruction. IN NO CIRCUMSTANCE CAN ANY GOODS, PRODUCTS OR INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY EVER BE RE-SOLD. Carrier understands and agrees that in no event shall Carrier nor any Carrier Actors, without the prior express written consent of Niagara: (i) cause, suffer or permit the transfer, salvage, disposal and/or donation of any Goods, Products or Intellectual Property, and/or (ii) offer to transfer, salvage, dispose of and/or donate any Goods, Products or Intellectual Property, whether as salvage or otherwise. Notwithstanding the foregoing, if there is a distressed, damaged or otherwise rejected Load of product that is not returned to a Niagara facility, and Niagara gives express written permission to a Carrier to dispose of or donate the goods or products, Niagara shall require written verification, signed by the Carrier’s authorized agent, which provides exact details as to the final disposition as well as copies of donation/disposal receipts as backup.  
f) **Claim Settlement.** In order to close a freight claim as settled, one of the following conclusions must be obtained:  
- Granted: paid in full  
- Declined: written declination including a specific legal reason  
- Compromised: written offer to settle for less than the original claim amount, including legal rationale for offer to pay less than full amount claimed  

g) **Payment.** Any and all payments from Carrier to Niagara in settlement of a claim must be made, in full, and sent to: Niagara Bottling, LLC 2560 E. Philadelphia Street Ontario, CA 91761 Attention: Claims Specialist Niagara’s claim reference number must appear on the check. A partial payment check will not be accepted and will not be cashed as a granted or settled claim.

**Seals.** Carrier agrees to comply with the Food and Drug Administration and industry standards with regard to seals as codified in FDA 21 CFR 110.93, which states that all transportation of food shall be under conditions to protect that food. Storage and transportation of finished food shall be under conditions that will protect the food against physical, chemical, and microbial contamination as well as against deterioration of the food and the container. Carrier further agrees to use standard industry practices, including, but not limited to ensuring that any and all trailers from or on behalf of Niagara will be kept sealed while transporting all goods. Carrier must confirm that the seal has been secured on the trailer and that the seal number is recorded on the BOL by Niagara prior to leaving any of Niagara’s facilities. If the seal is required to be broken at any time during transport, Carrier must first seek Niagara’s authorization. Carrier must then notify Niagara that the trailer has been re-sealed by sending an e-mail to executionteam@niagarawater.com. In the event Niagara’s customer breaks the seal, rejects the Load, and does not provide Carrier with a new seal to re-seal the trailer, Niagara’s customer or Carrier must add a lock to the trailer to secure the Load. It is Carrier’s sole responsibility to ensure that the trailer is re-sealed or a lock is added to the trailer prior to leaving Niagara’s customer’s facilities. No Loads will be accepted by Niagara without a seal or lock on the trailer.

**Insurance.** During the term of all Awards, agreements or purchase orders, and after any termination of or expiration, and for as long as Carrier owes any obligation to Niagara and/or any statute of limitations for any potential claim that Niagara may have against Carrier remains unexpired, Carrier and any Carrier Actors shall maintain all insurance and/or bonds required by statute, law and any Award, agreement or purchase order with minimum insurance limits consistent with Niagara’s insurance requirements set forth at the end of this Section 16. Should insurance policy limits be exhausted or should Carrier or any Carrier Actors fail to maintain the required insurance coverage, neither Carrier nor any Carrier Actor will in any way be relieved from liability provided for herein to Niagara should a loss occur. Carrier shall furnish Niagara with a certificate evidencing the aforementioned coverage limits via email to insurancecerts@niagarawater.com. Such certificate shall provide for thirty (30) days written notice to Niagara in the event of cancellation. All certificates of insurance shall name Niagara Bottling, LLC and its parents, subsidiaries, employees, agents, affiliates and assigns as an additional insured by policy endorsement (on both Carrier’s General Liability Policy, Automobile Liability Policy and Cargo Insurance Policy) and waive all rights of subrogation against Niagara, its parent, director, officers, employees, stockholders, subsidiaries and affiliates with regard to Employee Liability and Workers Compensation. For any claims relating to an Agreement, agreement or purchase order, the Carrier’s insurance shall be deemed to be primary and not contributing to or in excess of any similar coverage purchased by Niagara. Carrier hereby acknowledges that naming Niagara Bottling, LLC and its parents, subsidiaries, employees, agents, affiliates and assigns as an additional insured by policy endorsement is a condition precedent to payment by Niagara. For the avoidance of doubt, Niagara will not be required to submit payment until the requirements of this provision have been met. However, failure of Niagara to demand any certificates or to identify any deficiency in the insurance provided shall not be construed as or deemed to be a waiver of the Carrier’s (or its agents or subcontractors) obligation to maintain such insurance. If any of the coverages are required to remain in force after termination of the Agreement, Carrier shall submit additional certificates evidencing continuation of coverage until such obligation ends.  

**Niagara’s Minimum Insurance Requirements:**  
- Commercial General Liability $2,000,000 per occurrence; $5,000,000 aggregate  
- Auto Liability $3,000,000 combined single limit  
- Cargo $100,000  
- Employee Liability/Workman’s Comp $2,000,000/Statutory  

In addition to the general insurance requirements provided in the above table, customized insurance requirements for specific Seller-types are attached hereto and incorporated herein by this reference.

**Termination.**  
a) Any Award, agreement or purchase order shall commence on the date such Award is given, agreement is entered into or purchase order is issued, and shall automatically renew on a year-to-year basis until terminated, provided that Carrier is performing in accordance with these Carrier Standard T&C’s, the Award, agreement or purchase order, and that Carrier continues to provide Niagara the lowest available rates in the market and the lowest rates and/or most favorable terms at which Carrier offers its service to any third party shipper in the same functional level of the trade as Niagara (“Most Favorable Rates”). The Parties agree to meet in good faith to discuss existing rates at a time no earlier than twelve (12) months after the Award is issued or an agreement is entered into by the Parties. Such discussions may result in a rate adjustment if, and only if, the adjustment is in reference to driver pay, and only upon mutual written consent by both Parties. Notwithstanding the foregoing, Carrier guarantees that any rate increase will not exceed 2% of the current rate. In the event that Carrier does not provide Niagara with the Most Favorable Rates, Niagara shall have the right to terminate by giving thirty (30) days written notice to Carrier.  
b) If during the term specified by any Award, agreement, or purchase order either party (i) files a petition in bankruptcy or has a petition in bankruptcy filed against it that is not dismissed within sixty (60) days, or (ii) makes a general assignment for the benefit of creditors, then in any such case the non-bankrupt party may terminate any Award, agreement or purchase order by giving written notice of such effect to the bankrupt party.  
c) If all or any portion of Carrier’s registration, as required by any Award, agreement or purchase order, is revoked, canceled, suspended, or discontinued by operation of law or otherwise (“Registration Issue”), or if Carrier’s insurance policies are canceled, reduced or otherwise invalidated (“Insurance Issue”), Carrier shall promptly notify Niagara, and in no case later than forty-eight (48) hours after Carrier learns of any such Registration or Insurance Issue and Niagara shall have the right to terminate any Award, agreement or purchase order immediately and/or collect reimbursement for all expenses it has incurred in preparation of and/or as a result of any Award, agreement or purchase order from Carrier. Carrier’s notification to Niagara in regards to the above shall in no way serve as a waiver by Niagara of its right to construe such as a breach of any Award, agreement or purchase order and shall in no way limit Niagara’s right to pursue all remedies in law or equity as a result of such breach.  
d) If, in Niagara’s sole discretion, delays in transportation cause inconvenience and/or harm to Niagara’s business interests, or Carrier is otherwise in breach of any Award, agreement or purchase order, Niagara shall provide written notice to Carrier outlining the delay and resulting or anticipated harm and/or breach. If the deficiencies and/or breach remain following a period of thirty (30) days from the date written notice was provided, as is measured as of the date specified on the notice, Niagara may terminate any Award, agreement or purchase order upon thirty (30) days written notice to Carrier.  
e) In the event of any discontinuation and/or revision to any regulations and/or laws in the United States (or any other country where Carrier services Niagara), and/or if Niagara, in its sole discretion, determines that the services contemplated in any Award, agreement or purchase order are no longer necessary or required and/or that Niagara’s course of business strategy has changed, Niagara may terminate any Award, agreement or purchase order in part or in its entirety upon sixty (60) days’ notice to Carrier.  
f) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary herein, Niagara shall have the ability to terminate any Award, agreement or purchase order for convenience with a sixty (60) day written notice, and Carrier shall have the ability to terminate any Award or agreement with one hundred eighty (180) day written notice to Niagara.

**General Provisions.**  
a) **Confidentiality.** Throughout the term of any Award, agreement or purchase order between the Parties, the Parties may come into possession of information or data which constitute trade secrets, know-how, confidential information or are otherwise considered to be secret (hereinafter “Confidential Information”). In consideration of the receipt of such Confidential Information, Parties agree to maintain such Confidential Information in the utmost of confidence, use such Confidential Information solely in connection with the business relationship established hereunder and take all measures reasonable and appropriate to protect such Confidential Information.  
b) **Severability.** If any phrase, clause, sentence, or other provision contained in these Standard Carrier T&C’s, or any Award, agreement or purchase order shall violate any applicable statute, ordinance, rule or law, are deemed inoperative or unenforceable then the same shall be deemed severed here, to the extent of such violation; provided, however, that the remainder of these Standard Carrier T&C’s, or any Award, agreement or purchase order shall remain in effect.  
c) **Notices.** Except as specifically provided herein, any notices required hereunder shall become effective when delivered personally or sent by registered mail, certified mail or overnight courier service to the Parties at their respective addresses. Notice shall be deemed given upon personal delivery or on the receipt of registered, certified or overnight mail. Notices to Niagara shall be sent to: Niagara Bottling, LLC, 2560 E. Philadelphia Street, Ontario, California 91761, Attn: Vice President of Legal Affairs and via email to panderson@niagarawater.com.  
d) **Anti-Kickback.** Carrier will not make any payment or transfer anything of value, directly or indirectly, to any employee of Niagara. It is the intent of the parties that no payments or transfers of anything of value shall be made which may have the purpose or effect (real or perceived) of bribery, acceptance of or acquiescence in kickbacks or other improper means of obtaining business.  
e) **Inspection.** Upon request by Niagara, any duly authorized representative of Niagara shall, until two (2) years after final payment under an Award, agreement or purchase order between the Parties, have access to and right to examine directly pertinent books, papers, documents, accounts and records of Carrier involving transactions between the Parties.  
f) **Independent Contractor.** Carrier shall act as an independent contractor and not as an agent or employee of Niagara.  
g) **Mitigation of Damages.** In the event that Carrier is unable to perform any obligation, in whole or in part, under any Award, agreement or purchase order between the Parties, Niagara shall be entitled to purchase the requisite Transportation Services from another available source and Carrier will be liable for any additional costs incurred by Niagara.  
h) **Force Majeure.** In the event of storms, acts of God, riots, civil insurrection, flood, strike, war or any other force majeure event that reduces or otherwise limits Carrier’s Transportation Service or delivery capabilities, Carrier shall use best efforts to meet its commitments to Niagara in accordance with any Award, agreement or purchase order.  
i) These Standard Carrier T&C’s and/or any Award, agreement or purchase order shall exclusively govern any relationship between Niagara and Carrier. To the extent that there is any conflict between these Standard Carrier T&C’s and/or any Award, agreement or purchase order, these Standard Carrier T&C’s shall control. Any additional or contrary terms set forth in any of the Parties’ purchase orders, bills of lading, invoices, or other documentation shall have no force or effect.  
j) **Applicable Law.** These Standard Carrier T&C’s and/or any Award, agreement or purchase order shall be interpreted under the laws of the State of California. Any action arising out of or related to these Standard Carrier T&C’s and/or any Award, agreement or purchase order between the Parties or any of the dealings between the Parties hereto shall be brought and venued in the State or Federal courts located in San Bernardino County, California.  
k) **Dispute Resolution.** In the event of any dispute arising out of or related to these Standard Carrier T&C’s and/or any Award, agreement or purchase order between the Parties, the Parties shall make a good faith effort, within thirty (30) days of such dispute, to meet in person to discuss potential amicable resolution of this dispute. During this time, where the Parties are exploring resolution of the dispute, Niagara shall not be in breach due to nonpayment of any invoice. This provision shall not be interpreted to release, postpone or alter any of Carrier’s obligations set forth herein.  
l) **Attorneys’ Fees.** In the event a dispute cannot be resolved with respect to these Standard Carrier T&C’s and/or any Award, agreement or purchase order between the Parties or the Transportation Services contemplated herein, the prevailing Party in such dispute shall be entitled to recover all actual and reasonable expenses including, without limitation, reasonable attorneys’ fees and expenses incurred in ascertaining such Party’s rights in preparing to enforce, or enforcing such Party’s rights under these Standard Carrier T&C’s and/or any Award, agreement or purchase, whether or not it was necessary for such party to institute a suit in a court of law.  

**Accessorial Terms**  
The following shall apply to all Awards and agreements between the Parties for Transportation Services:  
a) **On-Time Requirement.** In the event that Carrier’s driver arrives between the window of thirty (30) minutes before or thirty (30) minutes after any pick-up appointment, Niagara shall check-in and Load Carrier’s trailer. If Carrier’s driver arrives between the window of thirty-one (31) minutes to two (2) hours after any pick-up appointment, no accessorial charges or fees will be owed by Niagara, and Niagara will make commercially reasonable efforts to check-in and Load Carrier’s trailer. In the event that Carrier’s driver arrives to any pick-up appointment over two (2) hours late, no accessorial charges or fees will be paid by Niagara to Carrier, and Niagara may, at its sole discretion, reject and not Load the trailer, and assess no show charges against Carrier.  
b) **Free Wait Time.** Two (2) hours of free waiting time will be honored by the Carrier at both origin and destination.  
c) **Detention Rates.** Niagara shall pay detention rates for pick-up from Niagara facility or delivery to Niagara’s customer at a rate not to exceed $50/hour after two (2) hours of free waiting time, which shall not exceed a total of $250.00 per day. Detention rates on all invoices must correspond with Niagara’s BOL in and out times, and be evidenced by both in and out times and show the location in which the charges were accrued. No detention rate shall be owed if Carrier is more than thirty (30) minutes late for its pick-up or delivery appointment.  
d) **Drop Trailer Detention.** In the event that Carrier’s trailer has been dropped at Niagara’s customer location and has not been unloaded by customer within forty-eight (48) hours, Carrier shall immediately notify Niagara. Upon notification to Niagara, Niagara shall have twenty-four (24) hours to resolve the issue and Carrier agrees not to charge Niagara with any fees or penalties. In the event Carrier’s trailer is not released after this time period, Niagara agrees to pay Carrier a drop trailer detention rate not to exceed $40 per day. Carrier shall monitor the status of any detained trailer and provide Niagara with daily notifications as to the status of such detained trailer via email to executionteam@niagarawater.com. Release of a trailer shall immediately end all drop trailer detention rate charges to Niagara. Carrier shall invoice Niagara separately for any drop trailer detention rates. Carrier will agree to communicate any potential issue leading to an accessorial charge at the time an incident occurs in order to allow Niagara an opportunity to resolve the issue. All accessorial charges requested 24 hours after an incident has occurred will not be approved. Niagara will have the sole discretion to approve any accessorial charges caused by weather or force majeure.  
e) **Stop-off Charges.** Not to exceed $50.00 per additional stop.  
f) **Layover Charges:** Not to exceed $250.00 per day.  
g) In no event shall Carrier be able to charge Niagara both a detention charge and a layover charge, nor shall Carrier charge Niagara both detention and TONU charges.  
h) **Truck Order Not Used (“TONU”).** TONU charge shall not exceed $250. In no event will TONU charge exceed the cost of the products being transported. Carrier agrees that it shall not issue any TONU charges if 1) Carrier’s driver leaves the pick-up location on his own accord, 2) if Carrier tells its driver to leave the pick-up location without contacting and coordinating a pick-up appointment with Niagara, or 3) if Carrier’s driver arrives more than thirty (30) minutes after their scheduled pick-up appointment time.  
i) **No Show Charge.** If Carrier fails to pick up a tender that Carrier previously accepted and fails to notify Niagara at least 12 hours prior to the scheduled pick-up time, then Niagara may charge Carrier a no-show charge in the amount of $150 dollars or deduct the same from Carrier’s account with reference to the purchase order number for the tender of the Load.  
j) **Lumper.** If Carrier is prohibited from unloading a trailer and Customer requires the hiring of a Lumper, Niagara agrees to reimburse Carrier for any Lumper, provided Carrier provides the Lumper receipt for the exact amount charged by the lumper service, with no markup, to each invoice referencing the corresponding purchase order number.  
k) **Driver Assist.** If Niagara’s customer is requiring Carrier to unload via driver assist, the charge will not exceed $50 per Load.  
l) **Re-Delivery.** In the event Niagara’s customer rejects or refuses delivery of a Load due to the fault of the Carrier, such as arriving late for delivery appointment, Carrier must redeliver the Load at no further cost or expense to Niagara. In the event Niagara’s customer rejects or refuses delivery of a Load due to no fault of Carrier, Carrier agrees to redeliver the Load at a cost equal to or less than the cost of initial delivery. Carrier agrees to make every attempt to hold the Load in close proximity to Niagara’s customer’s delivery location.  
m) **Diversion Charges.** In the event that Carrier attempts to deliver to a location as specified by Niagara, and the Load is rejected, Niagara reserves the right to divert Carrier’s driver to another customer location within 150 miles of the original delivery location. Niagara shall pay diversion costs in accordance with the following chart:  

| Distance from Original Location in miles | Diversion Rate to be Paid to Carrier (in US Dollars) |
|------------------------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------|
| 0-25                                    | $50                                                 |
| 26-50                                   | $100                                                |
| 51-100                                  | $200                                                |
| 101-150                                 | $250                                                |

Hereinafter, “Broker” and “Carrier” shall collectively be referred to as “Carrier.” “Lanes” shall mean movement of a load from Niagara’s facility to Niagara’s customer’s facility, as specified by Niagara. “Load” shall mean a single truckload. “Transportation Services” shall mean motor carrier services provided by Carrier for the transport, hauling, or delivery of any commodity, including finished products, pallets, or Loads. “Award” shall mean document from Niagara to Carrier, signed by Carrier notifying Carrier of any Lane or Load awarded to Carrier, and Carrier’s acceptance of such an award. “Party” or “Parties” shall mean Niagara or Carrier individually or collectively.

**Pricing**  
During the term as set forth by Niagara in its sole discretion, as described in any Award or agreement, Carrier agrees only to charge the rates set forth by Niagara (“Base Rate”) for the Transportation Services in Lanes and/or Loads as requested by Niagara as full and complete compensation for the Transportation Services being provided by Carrier. Should Niagara provide an Award to Carrier for additional Lanes and/or Loads to provide Transportation Services to, such additional Award will be subject to these Standard Carrier T&C’s.

**Payment Terms**  
Prior to commencement of Transportation Services, and in order to receive payment from Niagara, Carrier must provide Niagara with a Certificate of Insurance (COI) in accordance with Section 16 herein. Carrier shall only invoice Niagara for awarded Lanes and/or Loads received from Niagara. Such invoice and all supporting documents shall be submitted promptly, following transport of any Load to Niagara via email at truckingbackup@niagarawater.com. Such invoices must include Carrier’s name and invoice number in the subject line. Each email shall only include one (1) invoice per email submission. Failure to comply with the terms of this section shall result in delay and/or non-payment of charges. Niagara will pay any undisputed portion of Carrier’s properly submitted invoice within thirty (30) days of receipt of invoice and supporting documentation. Any and all payments by Niagara shall be deemed effective as of the date of postmark. Niagara shall have no liability for invoices that are not received within ninety (90) days of transport of any Load. Niagara shall have no liability for added, balance due, accessorial, or any other charges of any nature which are not provided by the Award and which are not submitted within ninety (90) days from the date of transport of a Load. Carrier agrees to apply payment to the amount due for the specified invoice regardless of whether there are earlier unpaid invoices. In the event any payment becomes overdue, Carrier shall provide written notice to nonpayment via certified mail to: Attn: Vice President of Legal Affairs, Niagara Bottling, LLC, 2560 E. Philadelphia Street, Ontario, California 91761. Carrier shall also notify Niagara by sending emails to the following: Debra Morrison at dmorrison@niagarawater.com and transprocurement@niagarawater.com. Upon actual receipt of certified mail notice, Niagara shall have ten (10) days to cure any late payment. At no time during this cure period will Niagara be deemed in breach. In the event of timely cure by Niagara, Niagara shall not be deemed in breach and shall not be charged any late charges, late fees, penalties, or interest. In no event shall Carrier have a lien on any of Niagara’s Loads, products, or finished goods to secure payment of any invoices or charges. Carrier agrees to comply with all technological requirements of Niagara and its customers, including but not limited to 100% transactional compliance and specifically 204-Load Tender, 210-Carrier Invoice, 214-Shipment Status, and 990-Load Tender Response. Carrier shall be solely responsible for any and all costs for and associated with such technology.

**Award Acceptance**  
Once Carrier signs and accepts any Award, Carrier agrees to transport a minimum of 99% of any tender offers for such Lane(s). If Carrier falls below this 99% threshold, Carrier agrees to be liable for all damages arising due to Carrier’s failure, plus a fee equal to 4% of Carrier’s Base Rate. Such damages include, but are not limited to, costs incurred by Niagara in excess of the Base Rate to secure delivery of any Loads described in such tender offer by a third-party carrier. Should Niagara subsequently offer tenders for Loads not included in the Award or agreement and Carrier agrees to transport such Loads, Carrier agrees to transport such Load at the same rates as the delivery of Loads in the Award unless otherwise agreed to in writing by the Parties. Carrier must notify Niagara within ninety (90) minutes of receipt of Niagara’s tender offer that Carrier has: (a) received the tender offer; and (b) confirm that it will transport the Load.

**Carrier Performance**  
Carrier understands that all Transportation Services must be performed in a timely fashion. Carrier is solely responsible for scheduling and complying with any and all deliveries and delivery times as requested by Niagara’s customers.  
a) **Pick-up of Loads**: Carrier shall maintain a monthly on-time pick-up appointment rate of a minimum of 90% from the designated Niagara facility through the entire term of the Award. If Carrier’s monthly pick-up rate falls below 90%, Carrier agrees to a $50 fee for every late pick-up appointment for the previous month that caused Carrier to fall below the 90% pick-up rate.  
b) **Delivery of Loads**: Carrier shall maintain a 98% monthly rate for on-time delivery of Loads through the entire term of the Award. On-time delivery of Loads shall mean Loads delivered within thirty (30) minutes of a scheduled delivery appointment time. If Carrier’s monthly on-time delivery rate to Niagara or its customer’s locations falls below 98%, Carrier agrees to a $100 fee for every late and/or missed delivery appointment for the previous month that caused Carrier to fall below the 98% delivery rate.  
c) **Payload**: Carrier warrants that it has the ability to ship Loads that are 45,600 pounds or less. Niagara may scale and weigh all Loads and shall provide a pallet count for all Loads. In accepting any Load, Carrier agrees to count all pallet quantities prior to sealing the trailer. Niagara will make its best effort to produce a tactical forecast of the projected volume of Loads and weights for the upcoming month. In the event Niagara requests Carrier to haul 20% more of its projected daily volume, Carrier shall comply with such a request. In the event Carrier is unable to haul Niagara’s scale and weighted Load, causing Niagara to remove any products or pallets, Carrier agrees that Niagara may deduct a fee of $100 per occurrence from Carrier’s corresponding purchase order.  
d) **Equipment**: Carrier shall ensure that all equipment used in connection with performing Transportation Services be clean, odor-free, dry, leak-proof, and free of contamination and/or infestation. Carrier warrants that no motor vehicle, trailer, tractor, or other equipment that will be used for Transportation Services for Niagara has been used to transport refuse, garbage, trash, or solid or liquid waste of any kind, or any types of hazardous materials. Carrier agrees that any breach of this provision may result in substantial harm to Niagara’s products and/or customers, and may have a detrimental effect on Niagara’s reputation and image in the marketplace, product integrity, and goodwill. Niagara may, at its sole discretion, reject any and all trailers for issues including, but not limited to, odors, debris from prior shipment, or lack of structural integrity. Carriers shall not be permitted more than a 1% trailer rejection rate per month.  
e) **Operation**: Carrier shall ensure and bear all costs and expenses related to the operation of its motor vehicles, trailers, tractors, and equipment (“Carrier Equipment”), including ensuring that only fully qualified and licensed personnel operate any Carrier Equipment in accordance with, or as required by all applicable local, state, and/or federal laws, regulations, and authorities.  
f) **Customer Service**: Carrier, at its sole expense, must maintain and make available a telephone line for customer service to Niagara. Such customer service line will be operational twenty-four hours a day, seven days a week, and shall respond within thirty (30) minutes of contact by Niagara.

**Documentation**  
With respect to the following documents, Carrier agrees to maintain the documents as follows:  
a) **Daily reports**: Carrier shall provide Niagara daily reports regarding the status of all Loads and delivery times;  
b) **Proof of Delivery (POD)**: Carrier shall provide Niagara free of charge with any and all PODs within 48 hours of delivery of any Load, and shall maintain all such PODs for at least twelve (12) months from the date of delivery, or for a period as proscribed by law;  
c) **Bill of Lading (BOL)**: Carrier agrees that Niagara’s bill of lading shall be considered: (i) an acceptable form of receipt hereunder, and (ii) specific shipping instructions. These Standard Carrier T&C’s shall be incorporated by reference into each and every such BOL and in the event of an inconsistency, these Standard Carrier T&C’s shall control;  
d) **Supporting documents for Accessorial charges**: Carrier agrees to provide all documents in accordance with Section 18 of these Standard Terms and Conditions.

**Carrier Failure to provide Proof of Delivery (POD)**  
In the event Carrier fails to provide a POD within 48 hours of delivery, Niagara shall have the right to deduct all amounts paid for Transportation Services, or demand payment for the amount of the Transportation Service invoice. Additionally, if Carrier cannot provide the POD within fourteen (14) days of delivery, Niagara may charge Carrier for the cost of any of Niagara’s customer’s invoice for product not paid. Alternatively, if Niagara receives a refusal to pay for a Load from its customer, Niagara will provide Carrier with evidence of customer refusal and proof of loss, and shall charge Carrier the cost of the customer’s invoice for the product.

**Assignment and Subcontracting**  
Carrier agrees not to interline, use other motor carriers or brokers, or to use “substituted services” or otherwise assign or subcontract any portion of any Award, agreement, or purchase order without the express written consent of Niagara. If, with the express written permission of Niagara, Carrier elects to use a delivery agent or subcontract the transportation of a Load, Carrier shall be the sole bearer of any costs associated with the delivery agent or subcontractor and agrees to be fully liable for any loss, damage, or delay to transportation of any such Loads while in this third-party carrier’s care, custody, and/or control. Carrier understands and agrees that all payments made by Niagara are conditioned upon Niagara’s receipt of a conditional waiver and release executed by Carrier and an unconditional waiver and release executed by each Additional Party. Carrier agrees to defend, indemnify, and hold Niagara and its customers harmless from any and all claims of any Additional Party for payment. Carrier acknowledges and agrees that Carrier shall remain, at all times, fully liable for all Additional Parties. Carrier warrants that it shall ensure that Additional Parties comply with and adhere to all warranties, representations, obligations, terms, and conditions contained herein.

**Compliance with Law**  
At all times during the Award or agreement term or its relationship with Niagara, Carrier shall comply with all applicable state and federal laws. Additionally, Carrier shall operate all Carrier Equipment in compliance with industry standards and shall maintain and operate the same such that Carrier’s safety rating does not fall below “satisfactory” under the Federal Motor Carrier Safety Administration standards. In the event that Carrier’s safety rating falls below “satisfactory,” Carrier shall notify Niagara immediately, and Niagara will have the immediate right to terminate any Award, agreement, or purchase order upon notice to Carrier.

**Indemnification**  
a) Carrier agrees to indemnify, defend, and hold Niagara, its affiliates, and representatives harmless from and against any and all claims arising out of or related to any Award, agreement, or purchase order and/or Transportation Services that are the subject thereof, including but not limited to: (i) any bodily injury or property damage claims, and any liability, loss, cost, expense, or other damages (including reasonable attorney fees) brought about by any injury of any kind suffered by any person or property as a result of any act, neglect, default, omission of either the Carrier, Carrier’s agents, employees, affiliates, subcontractors, or any third party for whose actions Carrier is responsible (“Carrier Actors”), or Niagara, Niagara’s agents, employees, affiliates, subcontractors, or other representatives; (ii) any negligent act, misfeasance, or nonfeasance by Carrier, or Carrier Actors; (iii) any harm, injury, damage, or loss arising out of or in connection with the Transportation Services provided; (iv) third-party consumer claims, suits, and/or demands, including costs and expenses of investigation and settlement and attorneys’ fees and expenses, to the extent such claims arise from: (a) any act or omission by Carrier or Carrier Actors relating to or affecting the condition, quality, or character of any Goods or Services provided; or (b) trademark, copyright, trade dress, or patent infringement. Carrier acknowledges and agrees that Carrier must receive Niagara’s express written approval prior to settling any claim or lawsuit. Niagara reserves the right at any time to control its own defense.  
b) Should Carrier receive (or become aware of) any demand, service of process, notice, action, settlement, summons, complaint, or the like from or by a third party alleging that a Party hereto is responsible for some injury, act, omission, breach, negligence, claim, loss, violation of law, settlement, cost, expense, obligation, liability, damage, recovery, deficiency, or otherwise, including, without limitation, interest, penalties, reasonable attorney fees, and costs (each, a “Claim”) that arises out of, results from, or in any way relates to the subject matter of these Standard Terms and Conditions, an Award, agreement, or purchase order, then Carrier shall immediately (but no later than five (5) business days after receipt, or becoming aware, of a third-party Claim) provide Niagara with written notice regarding each third-party Claim of which Carrier is or becomes aware. Carrier covenants and agrees that should Carrier fail to provide Niagara with timely written notice regarding any third-party Claim, Carrier hereby generally and expressly waives, relinquishes, and releases, and agrees to hold harmless, Niagara from and against any and all Claims capable of being asserted by Carrier against Niagara in connection therewith.  
c) In the event Carrier utilizes any party (“Additional Party”) regardless of that party’s legal designation of contractor, subcontractor, materials supplier, agent, or otherwise, for the purpose of performing any Transportation Services, Carrier shall submit to Niagara written notice of (i) each Additional Party, (ii) the duties each Additional Party will undertake, (iii) the amount of compensation each Additional Party is to receive from Carrier, and (iv) Carrier’s compensation schedule and payment terms with the Additional Party. Carrier understands submitting this written notice as set forth above is a condition precedent to payment. Such written notice must be sent to Vice President of Legal Affairs via email and certified mail (1) panderson@niagarawater.com, (2) 2560 E. Philadelphia St., Ontario, CA 91761.  
g) **Waiver**: Niagara’s delay, failure, or partial exercise of any provision herein or waiver of any breach, right, or remedy contained in or granted by any Award, agreement, or purchase order shall not be deemed a waiver of any breach, right, or remedy unless expressly stated as such by Niagara in writing signed by an authorized representative of Niagara, and then such waiver shall be limited solely to its specific terms.

**Limitation of Liability**  
In no event shall Niagara be liable for any punitive, exemplary, special, incidental, indirect, or consequential damages of any kind (including, but not limited to loss of profits, loss of reputation, and/or loss of current or prospective business advantage, when where such losses are characterized as direct damages) arising out of or in any way related to the relationship and/or dealings between Niagara and Carrier regardless of whether the claim under which damages are sought is based upon contract, tort, negligence, strict liability, or otherwise, and regardless of whether the parties have been advised of the possibility of such damages at the time of contracting or otherwise. Under no circumstances shall Niagara’s maximum total liability, if any, arising out of or in any way related to the relationship and/or dealings between Niagara and Carrier exceed the amounts paid and/or due to Carrier by Niagara under any relationship between the Parties, Award, agreement, or purchase order.

**Liability for Loss, Damage, or Delay to Loads**  
a) Carrier agrees that in the transportation of all Loads hereunder, it shall assume, and does assume, the liability of an interstate motor carrier, as provided by 49 U.S.C. § 14706, with such liability to exist from the time of the receipt of any of said goods by Carrier until proper delivery has been made to the location specified by Niagara. The Parties expressly decline to limit the value of the property as permitted by 49 U.S.C. § 14706(c). All claims will be filed and resolved in accordance with the ICC regulations in 49 CFR Part 370.  
b) All Loads tendered to Carrier for transportation will be palletized and stretch wrapped. Carrier reserves the right to refuse to accept any Load that is not so packaged.  
c) Parties agree that each incident of transportation of product under any Award, agreement, or purchase order shall be evidenced by a BOL signed by Carrier and Niagara showing the kind, quantity, value, and condition of products or goods received and delivered by Carrier at the loading and unloading points respectively. Carrier’s duties and responsibilities under any Award, agreement, or purchase order between the Parties for the transport of any Load evidenced by such receipt shall commence when Carrier takes possession and control of Niagara’s property or upon execution of such receipt by Niagara, whichever occurs first, and shall end when consignee/customer/buyer signs a delivery receipt and Carrier delivers Niagara’s property. Carrier shall inspect all Loads prior to accepting possession and control and shall document any evidence of damage on the BOL. If Carrier does not indicate damage on the BOL at the time of possession and immediately communicates the existence of such damage to Niagara, Carrier agrees that damage documented upon delivery presumptively occurred while the Load was in Carrier’s custody and possession.  
d) The time limit within which Niagara must file a claim for damaged or lost products or goods against Carrier shall be nine (9) months from the date of delivery or within nine (9) months of the reasonably anticipated date of delivery in the event of a complete loss. All claims shall be paid, settled, or disallowed by Carrier within ninety (90) days of filing. Disallowance shall state a lawful reason for declining to accept responsibility for the claim, and shall be stated by Carrier, not its insurer. In no event shall Niagara be required to work with Carrier’s insurer directly. Niagara agrees to immediately provide written notice of claim to Carrier showing kind, quantity, value, and proof of carriage as evidenced by a signed BOL.  

**Product Loss or Damage**  
a) **Rejected Load**: In the event the Niagara’s customer rejects the delivery of any Load due to the fault of Carrier, Carrier must return the Load to the pick-up origin designated by Niagara at no cost. In the event Niagara’s customer rejects the delivery of a Load due to no fault of the Carrier, Niagara shall pay a transportation rate equal to the rate Niagara paid Carrier to transport the Load to Niagara’s customer. Any and all rejected Loads not scheduled for redelivery must be delivered back to Niagara’s pick-up origin within five (5) days from the time/date of initial pick-up. Any Load being transported back to Niagara’s pick-up origin must be secured with either a seal or padlock and a confirmation must be sent via email to executionteam@niagarawater.com. Return charges for short-haul clusters will be returned at half the published rate of the Load. For long-haul cluster freight, return charges will not exceed the total all-in rate of the Load.  
b) **Visual Damage to Products**: For damages to individual cases of product up to less than one pallet, Niagara’s customer must note the damage on the BOL, and customer or Carrier may dispose of or donate damaged cases of product. For damage to one or more pallets, Niagara’s customer must note the damage on the BOL. If the Load is rejected and remains in the custody of Carrier, Carrier must immediately contact Niagara Dispatch for deposition instructions. Carrier must provide the purchase order number, date and time of single delivery, number of pallets damaged and/or refused, bottle code, any photographs, a brief description of the damage, and contact information, including contact name, phone number, email, and facsimile number.  
c) **Concealed Damage to Products**: If Niagara’s customer reports concealed damage to the product, pallet, and/or Load, such damage will be investigated to determine liability. If the investigation concludes that Carrier is responsible for the damage, Carrier will be notified of Niagara’s intent to file a claim and will be given the opportunity to inspect the product, pallet, or Load prior to disposition for disposal or donation.  
d) **Product Loss/Delay**: In the event Carrier is unable to execute delivery for reasons such as theft of Load, vehicular accident, or delay impacting the product’s integrity (i.e., non-delivery of Load/products to its specified destination within five (5) calendar days), recovery of loss will be executed pursuant to 49 CFR 370.  
e) **Donation/Disposal**: Due to product liability, trademark protection, and/or licensing agreements for private label stock, any distressed, damaged, or otherwise rejected shipment that is not returned to a Niagara facility, for whatever reason, must be properly disposed of or donated in accordance with Niagara’s express written instruction. IN NO CIRCUMSTANCE CAN ANY GOODS, PRODUCTS, OR INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY EVER BE RE-SOLD. Carrier understands and agrees that in no event shall Carrier nor any Carrier Actors, without the prior express written consent of Niagara: (i) cause, suffer or permit the transfer, salvage, disposal, and/or donation of any Goods, Products, or Intellectual Property, and/or (ii) offer to transfer, salvage, dispose of, and/or donate any Goods, Products, or Intellectual Property, whether as salvage or otherwise. Notwithstanding the foregoing, if there is a distressed, damaged, or otherwise rejected Load of product that is not returned to a Niagara facility, and Niagara gives express written permission to a Carrier to dispose of or donate the goods or products, Niagara shall require written verification, signed by the Carrier’s authorized agent, which provides exact details as to the final disposition as well as copies of donation/disposal receipts as backup.  
f) **Claim Settlement**: In order to close a freight claim as settled, one of the following conclusions must be obtained:  
- Granted: paid in full  
- Declined: written declination including a specific legal reason  
- Compromised: written offer to settle for less than the original claim amount, including legal rationale for offer to pay less than full amount claimed  

**Payment**  
Any and all payments from Carrier to Niagara in settlement of a claim must be made, in full, and sent to:  
Niagara Bottling, LLC  
2560 E. Philadelphia Street  
Ontario, CA 91761  
Attention: Claims Specialist  
Niagara’s claim reference number must appear on the check. A partial payment check will not be accepted and will not be cashed as a granted or settled claim.

**Seals**  
Carrier agrees to comply with the Food and Drug Administration and industry standards with regard to seals as codified in FDA 21 CFR 110.93, which states that all transportation of food shall be under conditions to protect that food. Storage and transportation of finished food shall be under conditions that will protect the food against physical, chemical, and microbial contamination as well as against deterioration of the food and the container. Carrier further agrees to use standard industry practices, including, but not limited to ensuring that any and all trailers from or on behalf of Niagara will be kept sealed while transporting all goods. Carrier must confirm that the seal has been secured on the trailer and that the seal number is recorded on the BOL by Niagara prior to leaving any of Niagara’s facilities. If the seal is required to be broken at any time during transport, Carrier must first seek Niagara’s authorization. Carrier must then notify Niagara that the trailer has been re-sealed by sending an email to executionteam@niagarawater.com. In the event Niagara’s customer breaks the seal, rejects the Load, and does not provide Carrier with a new seal to re-seal the trailer, Niagara’s customer or Carrier must add a lock to the trailer to secure the Load. It is Carrier’s sole responsibility to ensure that the trailer is re-sealed or a lock is added to the trailer prior to leaving Niagara’s customer’s facilities. No Loads will be accepted by Niagara without a seal or lock on the trailer.

**Insurance**  
During the term of all Awards, agreements, or purchase orders, and after any termination of or expiration, and for as long as Carrier owes any obligation to Niagara and/or any statute of limitations for any potential claim that Niagara may have against Carrier remains unexpired, Carrier and any Carrier Actors shall maintain all insurance and/or bonds required by statute, law, and any Award, agreement, or purchase order with minimum insurance limits consistent with Niagara’s insurance requirements set forth at the end of this Section 16. Should insurance policy limits be exhausted or should Carrier or any Carrier Actors fail to maintain the required insurance coverage, neither Carrier nor any Carrier Actor will in any way be relieved from liability provided for herein to Niagara should a loss occur. Carrier shall furnish Niagara with a certificate evidencing the aforementioned coverage limits via email to insurancecerts@niagarawater.com. Such certificate shall provide for thirty (30) days written notice to Niagara in the event of cancellation. All certificates of insurance shall name Niagara Bottling, LLC and its parents, subsidiaries, employees, agents, affiliates, and assigns as an additional insured by policy endorsement (on both Carrier’s General Liability Policy, Automobile Liability Policy, and Cargo Insurance Policy) and waive all rights of subrogation against Niagara, its parent, director, officers, employees, stockholders, subsidiaries, and affiliates with regard to Employee Liability and Workers Compensation. For any claims relating to an Agreement, agreement, or purchase order, the Carrier’s insurance shall be deemed to be primary and not contributing to or in excess of any similar coverage purchased by Niagara. Carrier hereby acknowledges that naming Niagara Bottling, LLC and its parents, subsidiaries, employees, agents, affiliates, and assigns as an additional insured by policy endorsement is a condition precedent to payment by Niagara. For the avoidance of doubt, Niagara will not be required to submit payment until the requirements of this provision have been met. However, failure of Niagara to demand any certificates or to identify any deficiency in the insurance provided shall not be construed as or deemed to be a waiver of the Carrier’s (or its agents or subcontractors) obligation to maintain such insurance. If any of the coverages are required to remain in force after termination of the Agreement, Carrier shall submit additional certificates evidencing continuation of coverage until such obligation ends.  

**Niagara’s Minimum Insurance Requirements**:  
- Commercial General Liability: $2,000,000 per occurrence; $5,000,000 aggregate  
- Auto Liability: $3,000,000 combined single limit  
- Cargo: $100,000  
- Employee Liability/Workers Comp: $2,000,000/Statutory  

In addition to the general insurance requirements provided in the above table, customized insurance requirements for specific Seller-types are attached hereto and incorporated herein by this reference.

**Termination**  
a) Any Award, agreement, or purchase order shall commence on the date such Award is given, agreement is entered into, or purchase order is issued, and shall automatically renew on a year-to-year basis until terminated, provided that Carrier is performing in accordance with these Carrier Standard T&C’s, the Award, agreement, or purchase order, and that Carrier continues to provide Niagara the lowest available rates in the market and the lowest rates and/or most favorable terms at which Carrier offers its service to any third-party shipper in the same functional level of the trade as Niagara (“Most Favorable Rates”). The Parties agree to meet in good faith to discuss existing rates at a time no earlier than twelve (12) months after the Award is issued or an agreement is entered into by the Parties. Such discussions may result in a rate adjustment if, and only if, the adjustment is in reference to driver pay, and only upon mutual written consent by both Parties. Notwithstanding the foregoing, Carrier guarantees that any rate increase will not exceed 2% of the current rate. In the event that Carrier does not provide Niagara with the Most Favorable Rates, Niagara shall have the right to terminate by giving thirty (30) days written notice to Carrier.  
b) If during the term specified by any Award, agreement, or purchase order either party (i) files a petition in bankruptcy or has a petition in bankruptcy filed against it that is not dismissed within sixty (60) days, or (ii) makes a general assignment for the benefit of creditors, then in any such case the non-bankrupt party may terminate any Award, agreement, or purchase order by giving written notice of such effect to the bankrupt party.  
c) If all or any portion of Carrier’s registration, as required by any Award, agreement, or purchase order, is revoked, canceled, suspended, or discontinued by operation of law or otherwise (“Registration Issue”), or if Carrier’s insurance policies are canceled, reduced, or otherwise invalidated (“Insurance Issue”), Carrier shall promptly notify Niagara, and in no case later than forty-eight (48) hours after Carrier learns of any such Registration or Insurance Issue and Niagara shall have the right to terminate any Award, agreement, or purchase order immediately and/or collect reimbursement for all expenses it has incurred in preparation of and/or as a result of any Award, agreement, or purchase order from Carrier. Carrier’s notification to Niagara in regards to the above shall in no way serve as a waiver by Niagara of its right to construe such as a breach of any Award, agreement, or purchase order and shall in no way limit Niagara’s right to pursue all remedies in law or equity as a result of such breach.  
d) If, in Niagara’s sole discretion, delays in transportation cause inconvenience and/or harm to Niagara’s business interests, or Carrier is otherwise in breach of any Award, agreement, or purchase order, Niagara shall provide written notice to Carrier outlining the delay and resulting or anticipated harm and/or breach. If the deficiencies and/or breach remain following a period of thirty (30) days from the date written notice was provided, as is measured as of the date specified on the notice, Niagara may terminate any Award, agreement, or purchase order upon thirty (30) days written notice to Carrier.  
e) In the event of any discontinuation and/or revision to any regulations and/or laws in the United States (or any other country where Carrier services Niagara), and/or if Niagara, in its sole discretion, determines that the services contemplated in any Award, agreement, or purchase order are no longer necessary or required and/or that Niagara’s course of business strategy has changed, Niagara may terminate any Award, agreement, or purchase order in part or in its entirety upon sixty (60) days’ notice to Carrier.

The following shall apply to all Awards and agreements between the Parties for Transportation Services:  
a) **On-Time Requirement**: In the event that Carrier’s driver arrives between the window of thirty (30) minutes before or thirty (30) minutes after any pick-up appointment, Niagara shall check-in and Load Carrier’s trailer. If Carrier’s driver arrives between the window of thirty-one (31) minutes to two (2) hours after any pick-up appointment, no accessorial charges or fees will be owed by Niagara, and Niagara will make commercially reasonable efforts to check-in and Load Carrier’s trailer. In the event that Carrier’s driver arrives to any pick-up appointment over two (2) hours late, no accessorial charges or fees will be paid by Niagara to Carrier, and Niagara may, at its sole discretion, reject and not Load the trailer, and assess no-show charges against Carrier.  
b) **Free Wait Time**: Two (2) hours of free waiting time will be honored by the Carrier at both origin and destination.

Release of a trailer shall immediately end all drop trailer detention rate charges to Niagara. Carrier shall invoice Niagara separately for any drop trailer detention rates. Carrier will agree to communicate any potential issue leading to an accessorial charge at the time an incident occurs in order to allow Niagara an opportunity to resolve the issue.

i) **No Show Charge**: If Carrier fails to pick up a tender that Carrier previously accepted and fails to notify Niagara at least 12 hours prior to the scheduled pick-up time, then Niagara may charge Carrier a no-show charge in the amount of $150 dollars or deduct the same from Carrier’s account with reference to the purchase order number for the tender of the Load.  
j) **Lumper**: If Carrier is prohibited from unloading a trailer and Customer requires the hiring of a Lumper, Niagara agrees to reimburse Carrier for any Lumper, provided Carrier provides the Lumper receipt for the exact amount charged by the lumper service, with no markup, to each invoice referencing the corresponding purchase order number.  
k) **Driver Assist**: If Niagara’s customer is requiring Carrier to unload via driver assist, the charge will not exceed $50 per Load.  
l) **Re-Delivery**: In the event Niagara’s customer rejects or refuses delivery of a Load due to the fault of the Carrier, such as arriving late for delivery appointment, Carrier must redeliver the Load at no further cost or expense to Niagara.

Carrier agrees to make every attempt to hold the Load in close proximity to Niagara’s customer’s delivery location.  
m) **Diversion Charges**: In the event that Carrier attempts to deliver to a location as specified by Niagara, and the Load is rejected, Niagara reserves the right to divert Carrier’s driver to another customer location within 150 miles of the original delivery location.

Carrier shall be solely responsible for any and all costs for and associated with such technology.

**Award Acceptance**

If Carrier falls below this 99% threshold, Carrier agrees to be liable for all damages arising due to Carrier’s failure, plus a fee equal to 4% of Carrier’s Base Rate.

**Carrier Performance**  
Carrier understands that all Transportation Services must be performed in a timely fashion. Carrier is solely responsible for scheduling and complying with any and all deliveries and delivery times as requested by Niagara’s customers.  
a) **Pick-up of Loads**: Carrier shall maintain a monthly on-time pick-up appointment rate of a minimum of 90% from the designated Niagara facility through the entire term of the Award.

b) **Delivery of Loads**: Carrier shall maintain a 98% monthly rate for on-time delivery of Loads through the entire term of the Award. On-time delivery of Loads shall mean Loads delivered within thirty (30) minutes of a scheduled delivery appointment time. If Carrier’s monthly on-time delivery rate to Niagara or its customer’s locations falls below 98%, Carrier agrees to a $100 fee for every late and/or missed delivery appointment for the previous month that caused Carrier to fall below the 98% delivery rate.  
c) **Payload**: Carrier warrants that it has the ability to ship Loads that are 45,600 pounds or less. Niagara may scale and weigh all Loads and shall provide a pallet count for all Loads. In accepting any Load, Carrier agrees to count all pallet quantities prior to sealing the trailer. Niagara will make its best effort to produce a tactical forecast of the projected volume of Loads and weights for the upcoming month. In the event Niagara requests Carrier to haul 20% more of its projected daily volume, Carrier shall comply with such a request. In the event Carrier is unable to haul Niagara’s scale and weighted Load, causing Niagara to remove any products or pallets, Carrier agrees that Niagara may deduct a fee of $100 per occurrence from Carrier’s corresponding purchase order.  
d) **Equipment**: Carrier shall ensure that all equipment used in connection with performing Transportation Services be clean, odor-free, dry, leak-proof, and free of contamination and/or infestation. Carrier warrants that no motor vehicle, trailer, tractor, or other equipment that will be used for Transportation Services for Niagara has been used to transport refuse, garbage, trash, or solid or liquid waste of any kind, or any types of hazardous materials. Carrier agrees that any breach of this provision may result in substantial harm to Niagara’s products and/or customers and may have a detrimental effect on Niagara’s reputation and image in the marketplace, product integrity, and goodwill. Niagara may, at its sole discretion, reject any and all trailers for issues including, but not limited to, odors, debris from prior shipment, or lack of structural integrity. Carriers shall not be permitted more than a 1% trailer rejection rate per month.  
e) **Operation**: Carrier shall ensure and bear all costs and expenses related to the operation of its motor vehicles, trailers, tractors, and equipment (“Carrier Equipment”), including ensuring that only fully qualified and licensed personnel operate any Carrier Equipment in accordance with, or as required by all applicable local, state, and/or federal laws, regulations, and authorities.  
f) **Customer Service**: Carrier, at its sole expense, must maintain and make available a telephone line for customer service to Niagara. Such customer service line will be operational twenty-four hours a day, seven days a week, and shall respond within thirty (30) minutes of contact by Niagara.

**Documentation**  
With respect to the following documents, Carrier agrees to maintain the documents as follows:  
a) **Daily reports**: Carrier shall provide Niagara daily reports regarding the status of all Loads and delivery times;  
b) **Proof of Delivery (POD)**: Carrier shall provide Niagara free of charge with any and all PODs within 48 hours of delivery of any Load and shall maintain all such PODs for at least twelve (12) months from the date of delivery, or for a period as proscribed by law;  
c) **Bill of Lading (BOL)**: Carrier agrees that Niagara’s bill of lading shall be considered: (i) an acceptable form of receipt hereunder, and (ii) specific shipping instructions. These Standard Carrier T&C’s shall be incorporated by reference into each and every such BOL and in the event of an inconsistency, these Standard Carrier T&C’s shall control;  
d) **Supporting documents for Accessorial charges**: Carrier agrees to provide all documents in accordance with Section 18 of these Standard Terms and Conditions.

**Carrier Failure to provide Proof of Delivery (POD)**  
In the event Carrier fails to provide a POD within 48 hours of delivery, Niagara shall have the right to deduct all amounts paid for Transportation Services or demand payment for the amount of the Transportation Service invoice. Additionally, if Carrier cannot provide the POD within fourteen (14) days of delivery, Niagara may charge Carrier for the cost of any of Niagara’s customer’s invoice for product not paid. Alternatively, if Niagara receives a refusal to pay for a Load from its customer, Niagara will provide Carrier with evidence of customer refusal and proof of loss and shall charge Carrier the cost of the customer’s invoice for the product.

**Assignment and Subcontracting**  
Carrier agrees not to interline, use other motor carriers or brokers, or to use “substituted services” or otherwise assign or subcontract any portion of any Award, agreement, or purchase order without the express written consent of Niagara. If, with the express written permission of Niagara, Carrier elects to use a delivery agent or subcontract the transportation of a Load, Carrier shall be the sole bearer of any costs associated with the delivery agent or subcontractor and agrees to be fully liable for any loss, damage, or delay to the transportation of any such Loads while in this third-party carrier’s care, custody, and/or control. Carrier understands and agrees that all payments made by Niagara are conditioned upon Niagara’s receipt of a conditional waiver and release executed by Carrier and an unconditional waiver and release executed by each Additional Party. Carrier agrees to defend, indemnify, and hold Niagara and its customers harmless from any and all claims of any Additional Party for payment. Carrier acknowledges and agrees that Carrier shall remain, at all times, fully liable for all Additional Parties. Carrier warrants that it shall ensure that Additional Parties comply with and adhere to all warranties, representations, obligations, terms, and conditions contained herein.

**Compliance with Law**  
At all times during the Award or agreement term or its relationship with Niagara, Carrier shall comply with all applicable state and federal laws. Additionally, Carrier shall operate all Carrier Equipment in compliance with industry standards and shall maintain and operate the same such that Carrier’s safety rating does not fall below “satisfactory” under the Federal Motor Carrier Safety Administration standards. In the event that Carrier’s safety rating falls below “satisfactory,” Carrier shall notify Niagara immediately, and Niagara will have the immediate right to terminate any Award, agreement, or purchase order upon notice to Carrier.

**Indemnification**  
a) Carrier agrees to indemnify, defend, and hold Niagara, its affiliates, and representatives harmless from and against any and all claims arising out of or related to any Award, agreement, or purchase order and/or Transportation Services that are the subject thereof, including but not limited to: (i) any bodily injury or property damage claims, and any liability, loss, cost, expense, or other damages (including reasonable attorney fees) brought about by any injury of any kind suffered by any person or property as a result of any act, neglect, default, or omission of either the Carrier, Carrier’s agents, employees, affiliates, subcontractors, or any third party for whose actions Carrier is responsible (“Carrier Actors”), or Niagara, Niagara’s agents, employees, affiliates, subcontractors, or other representatives; (ii) any negligent act, misfeasance, or nonfeasance by Carrier or Carrier Actors; (iii) any harm, injury, damage, or loss arising out of or in connection with the Transportation Services provided; (iv) third-party consumer claims, suits, and/or demands, including costs and expenses of investigation and settlement and attorneys’ fees and expenses, to the extent such claims arise from: (a) any act or omission by Carrier or Carrier Actors relating to or affecting the condition, quality, or character of any Goods or Services provided; or (b) trademark, copyright, trade dress, or patent infringement. Carrier acknowledges and agrees that Carrier must receive Niagara’s express written approval prior to settling any claim or lawsuit. Niagara reserves the right at any time to control its own defense.  
b) Should Carrier receive (or become aware of) any demand, service of process, notice, action, settlement, summons, complaint, or the like from or by a third party alleging that a Party hereto is responsible for some injury, act, omission, breach, negligence, claim, loss, violation of law, settlement, cost, expense, obligation, liability, damage, recovery, deficiency, or otherwise, including, without limitation, interest, penalties, reasonable attorney fees, and costs (each, a “Claim”) that arises out of, results from, or in any way relates to the subject matter of these Standard Terms and Conditions, an Award, agreement, or purchase order, then Carrier shall immediately (but no later than five (5) business days after receipt, or becoming aware, of a third-party Claim) provide Niagara with written notice regarding each third-party Claim of which Carrier is or becomes aware. Carrier covenants and agrees that should Carrier fail to provide Niagara with timely written notice regarding any third-party Claim, Carrier hereby generally and expressly waives, relinquishes, and releases, and agrees to hold harmless, Niagara from and against any and all Claims capable of being asserted by Carrier against Niagara in connection therewith.  
c) In the event Carrier utilizes any party (“Additional Party”) regardless of that party’s legal designation of contractor, subcontractor, materials supplier, agent, or otherwise, for the purpose of performing any Transportation Services, Carrier shall submit to Niagara written notice of (i) each Additional Party, (ii) the duties each Additional Party will undertake, (iii) the amount of compensation each Additional Party is to receive from Carrier, and (iv) Carrier’s compensation schedule and payment terms with the Additional Party. Carrier understands that submitting this written notice as set forth above is a condition precedent to payment. Such written notice must be sent to the Vice President of Legal Affairs via email and certified mail (1) panderson@niagarawater.com, (2) 2560 E. Philadelphia St., Ontario, CA 91761.  
g) **Waiver**: Niagara’s delay, failure, or partial exercise of any provision herein or waiver of any breach, right, or remedy contained in or granted by any Award, agreement, or purchase order shall not be deemed a waiver of any breach, right, or remedy unless expressly stated as such by Niagara in writing signed by an authorized representative of Niagara, and then such waiver shall be limited solely to its specific terms.

**Limitation of Liability**  
In no event shall Niagara be liable for any punitive, exemplary, special, incidental, indirect, or consequential damages of any kind (including, but not limited to loss of profits, loss of reputation, and/or loss of current or prospective business advantage, when such losses are characterized as direct damages) arising out of or in any way related to the relationship and/or dealings between Niagara and Carrier regardless of whether the claim under which damages are sought is based upon contract, tort, negligence, strict liability, or otherwise, and regardless of whether the parties have been advised of the possibility of such damages at the time of contracting or otherwise. Under no circumstances shall Niagara’s maximum total liability, if any, arising out of or in any way related to the relationship and/or dealings between Niagara and Carrier exceed the amounts paid and/or due to Carrier by Niagara under any relationship between the Parties, Award, agreement, or purchase order.

**Liability for Loss, Damage, or Delay to Loads**  
a) Carrier agrees that in the transportation of all Loads hereunder, it shall assume, and does assume, the liability of an interstate motor carrier, as provided by 49 U.S.C. § 14706, with such liability to exist from the time of the receipt of any of said goods by Carrier until proper delivery has been made to the location specified by Niagara. The Parties expressly decline to limit the value of the property as permitted by 49 U.S.C. § 14706(c). All claims will be filed and resolved in accordance with the ICC regulations in 49 CFR Part 370.  
b) All Loads tendered to Carrier for transportation will be palletized and stretch-wrapped. Carrier reserves the right to refuse to accept any Load that is not so packaged.  
c) Parties agree that each incident of transportation of product under any Award, agreement, or purchase order shall be evidenced by a BOL signed by Carrier and Niagara showing the kind, quantity, value, and condition of products or goods received and delivered by Carrier at the loading and unloading points respectively. Carrier’s duties and responsibilities under any Award, agreement, or purchase order between the Parties for the transport of any Load evidenced by such receipt shall commence when Carrier takes possession and control of Niagara’s property or upon execution of such receipt by Niagara, whichever occurs first, and shall end when consignee/customer/buyer signs a delivery receipt and Carrier delivers Niagara’s property. Carrier shall inspect all Loads prior to accepting possession and control and shall document any evidence of damage on the BOL. If Carrier does not indicate damage on the BOL at the time of possession and immediately communicates the existence of such damage to Niagara, Carrier agrees that damage documented upon delivery presumptively occurred while the Load was in Carrier’s custody and possession.  
d) The time limit within which Niagara must file a claim for damaged or lost products or goods against Carrier shall be nine (9) months from the date of delivery or within nine (9) months of the reasonably anticipated date of delivery in the event of a complete loss. All claims shall be paid, settled, or disallowed by Carrier within ninety (90) days of filing. Disallowance shall state a lawful reason for declining to accept responsibility for the claim and shall be stated by Carrier, not its insurer. In no event shall Niagara be required to work with Carrier’s insurer directly. Niagara agrees to immediately provide written notice of claim to Carrier showing kind, quantity, value, and proof of carriage as evidenced by a signed BOL.  
e) In the event of Carrier’s breach, or alleged breach, as determined solely by Niagara, of any provision in any Award, agreement, or purchase order between the Parties, in addition to all other remedies in law or equity that are available to Niagara, Carrier shall be responsible for all reasonable attorneys’ fees and costs incurred by Niagara as a result of said breach or alleged breach.

**Product Loss or Damage**  
a) **Rejected Load**: In the event the Niagara’s customer rejects the delivery of any Load due to the fault of Carrier, Carrier must return the Load to the pick-up origin designated by Niagara at no cost. In the event Niagara’s customer rejects the delivery of a Load due to no fault of the Carrier, Niagara shall pay a transportation rate equal to the rate Niagara paid Carrier to transport the Load to Niagara’s customer. Any and all rejected Loads not scheduled for redelivery must be delivered back to Niagara’s pick-up origin within five (5) days from the time/date of initial pick-up. Any Load being transported back to Niagara’s pick-up origin must be secured with either a seal or padlock, and a confirmation must be sent via email to executionteam@niagarawater.com. Return charges for short-haul clusters will be returned at half the published rate of the Load. For long-haul cluster freight, return charges will not exceed the total all-in rate of the Load.  
b) **Visual Damage to Products**: For damages to individual cases of product up to less than one pallet, Niagara’s customer must note the damage on the BOL, and the customer or Carrier may dispose of or donate damaged cases of product. For damage to one or more pallets, Niagara’s customer must note the damage on the BOL. If the Load is rejected and remains in the custody of Carrier, Carrier must immediately contact Niagara Dispatch for deposition instructions. Carrier must provide the purchase order number, date and time of single delivery, number of pallets damaged and/or refused, bottle code, any photographs, a brief description of the damage, and contact information, including contact name, phone number, email, and facsimile number.  
c) **Concealed Damage to Products**: If Niagara’s customer reports concealed damage to the product, pallet, and/or Load, such damage will be investigated to determine liability. If the investigation concludes that Carrier is responsible for the damage, Carrier will be notified of Niagara’s intent to file a claim and will be given the opportunity to inspect the product, pallet, or Load prior to disposition for disposal or donation.  
d) **Product Loss/Delay**: In the event Carrier is unable to execute delivery for reasons such as theft of Load, vehicular accident, or delay impacting the product’s integrity (i.e., non-delivery of Load/products to its specified destination within five (5) calendar days), recovery of loss will be executed pursuant to 49 CFR 370.  
e) **Donation/Disposal**: Due to product liability, trademark protection, and/or licensing agreements for private label stock, any distressed, damaged, or otherwise rejected shipment that is not returned to a Niagara facility, for whatever reason, must be properly disposed of or donated in accordance with Niagara’s express written instruction. IN NO CIRCUMSTANCE CAN ANY GOODS, PRODUCTS, OR INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY EVER BE RE-SOLD. Carrier understands and agrees that in no event shall Carrier nor any Carrier Actors, without the prior express written consent of Niagara: (i) cause, suffer, or permit the transfer, salvage, disposal, and/or donation of any Goods, Products, or Intellectual Property, and/or (ii) offer to transfer, salvage, dispose of, and/or donate any Goods, Products, or Intellectual Property, whether as salvage or otherwise. Notwithstanding the foregoing, if there is a distressed, damaged, or otherwise rejected Load of product that is not returned to a Niagara facility, and Niagara gives express written permission to a Carrier to dispose of or donate the goods or products, Niagara shall require written verification, signed by the Carrier’s authorized agent, which provides exact details as to the final disposition as well as copies of donation/disposal receipts as backup.  
f) **Claim Settlement**: In order to close a freight claim as settled, one of the following conclusions must be obtained:  
- Granted: paid in full  
- Declined: written declination including a specific legal reason  
- Compromised: written offer to settle for less than the original claim amount, including legal rationale for the offer to pay less than the full amount claimed  

**Payment**  
Any and all payments from Carrier to Niagara in settlement of a claim must be made, in full, and sent to:  
Niagara Bottling, LLC  
2560 E. Philadelphia Street  
Ontario, CA 91761  
Attention: Claims Specialist  
Niagara’s claim reference number must appear on the check. A partial payment check will not be accepted and will not be cashed as a granted or settled claim.

**Seals**  
Carrier agrees to comply with the Food and Drug Administration and industry standards with regard to seals as codified in FDA 21 CFR 110.93, which states that all transportation of food shall be under conditions to protect that food. Storage and transportation of finished food shall be under conditions that will protect the food against physical, chemical, and microbial contamination as well as against deterioration of the food and the container. Carrier further agrees to use standard industry practices, including, but not limited to ensuring that any and all trailers from or on behalf of Niagara will be kept sealed while transporting all goods. Carrier must confirm that the seal has been secured on the trailer and that the seal number is recorded on the BOL by Niagara prior to leaving any of Niagara’s facilities. If the seal is required to be broken at any time during transport, Carrier must first seek Niagara’s authorization. Carrier must then notify Niagara that the trailer has been re-sealed by sending an email to executionteam@niagarawater.com. In the event Niagara’s customer breaks the seal, rejects the Load, and does not provide Carrier with a new seal to re-seal the trailer, Niagara’s customer or Carrier must add a lock to the trailer to secure the Load. It is Carrier’s sole responsibility to ensure that the trailer is re-sealed or a lock is added to the trailer prior to leaving Niagara’s customer’s facilities. No Loads will be accepted by Niagara without a seal or lock on the trailer.

**Insurance**  
During the term of all Awards, agreements, or purchase orders, and after any termination of or expiration, and for as long as Carrier owes any obligation to Niagara and/or any statute of limitations for any potential claim that Niagara may have against Carrier remains unexpired, Carrier and any Carrier Actors shall maintain all insurance and/or bonds required by statute, law, and any Award, agreement, or purchase order with minimum insurance limits consistent with Niagara’s insurance requirements set forth at the end of this Section 16. Should insurance policy limits be exhausted or should Carrier or any Carrier Actors fail to maintain the required insurance coverage, neither Carrier nor any Carrier Actor will in any way be relieved from liability provided for herein to Niagara should a loss occur. Carrier shall furnish Niagara with a certificate evidencing the aforementioned coverage limits via email to insurancecerts@niagarawater.com. Such certificate shall provide for thirty (30) days written notice to Niagara in the event of cancellation. All certificates of insurance shall name Niagara Bottling, LLC and its parents, subsidiaries, employees, agents, affiliates, and assigns as an additional insured by policy endorsement (on both Carrier’s General Liability Policy, Automobile Liability Policy, and Cargo Insurance Policy) and waive all rights of subrogation against Niagara, its parent, director, officers, employees, stockholders, subsidiaries, and affiliates with regard to Employee Liability and Workers Compensation. For any claims relating to an Agreement, agreement, or purchase order, the Carrier’s insurance shall be deemed to be primary and not contributing to or in excess of any similar coverage purchased by Niagara. Carrier hereby acknowledges that naming Niagara Bottling, LLC and its parents, subsidiaries, employees, agents, affiliates, and assigns as an additional insured by policy endorsement is a condition precedent to payment by Niagara. For the avoidance of doubt, Niagara will not be required to submit payment until the requirements of this provision have been met. However, failure of Niagara to demand any certificates or to identify any deficiency in the insurance provided shall not be construed as or deemed to be a waiver of the Carrier’s (or its agents or subcontractors) obligation to maintain such insurance. If any of the coverages are required to remain in force after termination of the Agreement, Carrier shall submit additional certificates evidencing continuation of coverage until such obligation ends.  

**Niagara’s Minimum Insurance Requirements**:  
- Commercial General Liability: $2,000,000 per occurrence; $5,000,000 aggregate  
- Auto Liability: $3,000,000 combined single limit  
- Cargo: $100,000  
- Employee Liability/Workman’s Comp: $2,000,000/Statutory  

In addition to the general insurance requirements provided in the above table, customized insurance requirements for specific Seller-types are attached hereto and incorporated herein by this reference.

**Termination**  
a) Any Award, agreement, or purchase order shall commence on the date such Award is given, agreement is entered into, or purchase order is issued, and shall automatically renew on a year-to-year basis until terminated, provided that Carrier is performing in accordance with these Carrier Standard T&C’s, the Award, agreement, or purchase order, and that Carrier continues to provide Niagara the lowest available rates in the market and the lowest rates and/or most favorable terms at which Carrier offers its service to any third-party shipper in the same functional level of the trade as Niagara (“Most Favorable Rates”). The Parties agree to meet in good faith to discuss existing rates at a time no earlier than twelve (12) months after the Award is issued or an agreement is entered into by the Parties. Such discussions may result in a rate adjustment if, and only if, the adjustment is in reference to driver pay, and only upon mutual written consent by both Parties. Notwithstanding the foregoing, Carrier guarantees that any rate increase will not exceed 2% of the current rate. In the event that Carrier does not provide Niagara with the Most Favorable Rates, Niagara shall have the right to terminate by giving thirty (30) days written notice to Carrier.  
b) If during the term specified by any Award, agreement, or purchase order either party (i) files a petition in bankruptcy or has a petition in bankruptcy filed against it that is not dismissed within sixty (60) days, or (ii) makes a general assignment for the benefit of creditors, then in any such case the non-bankrupt party may terminate any Award, agreement, or purchase order by giving written notice of such effect to the bankrupt party.  
c) If all or any portion of Carrier’s registration, as required by any Award, agreement, or purchase order, is revoked, canceled, suspended, or discontinued by operation of law or otherwise (“Registration Issue”), or if Carrier’s insurance policies are canceled, reduced, or otherwise invalidated (“Insurance Issue”), Carrier shall promptly notify Niagara, and in no case later than forty-eight (48) hours after Carrier learns of any such Registration or Insurance Issue, and Niagara shall have the right to terminate any Award, agreement, or purchase order immediately and/or collect reimbursement for all expenses it has incurred in preparation of and/or as a result of any Award, agreement, or purchase order from Carrier. Carrier’s notification to Niagara in regards to the above shall in no way serve as a waiver by Niagara of its right to construe such as a breach of any Award, agreement, or purchase order and shall in no way limit Niagara’s right to pursue all remedies in law or equity as a result of such breach.  
d) If, in Niagara’s sole discretion, delays in transportation cause inconvenience and/or harm to Niagara’s business interests, or Carrier is otherwise in breach of any Award, agreement, or purchase order, Niagara shall provide written notice to Carrier outlining the delay and resulting or anticipated harm and/or breach. If the deficiencies and/or breach remain following a period of thirty (30) days from the date written notice was provided, as is measured as of the date specified on the notice, Niagara may terminate any Award, agreement, or purchase order upon thirty (30) days written notice to Carrier.  
e) In the event of any discontinuation and/or revision to any regulations and/or laws in the United States (or any other country where Carrier services Niagara), and/or if Niagara, in its sole discretion, determines that the services contemplated in any Award, agreement, or purchase order are no longer necessary or required and/or that Niagara’s course of business strategy has changed, Niagara may terminate any Award, agreement, or purchase order in part or in its entirety upon sixty (60) days’ notice to Carrier.  
f) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary herein, Niagara shall have the ability to terminate any Award, agreement, or purchase order for convenience with a sixty (60) day written notice, and Carrier shall have the ability to terminate any Award or agreement with one hundred eighty (180) day written notice to Niagara.

**General Provisions**  
a) **Confidentiality**: Throughout the term of any Award, agreement, or purchase order between the Parties, the Parties may come into possession of information or data which constitute trade secrets, know-how, confidential information, or are otherwise considered to be secret (hereinafter “Confidential Information”). In consideration of the receipt of such Confidential Information, Parties agree to maintain such Confidential Information in the utmost of confidence, use such Confidential Information solely in connection with the business relationship established hereunder, and take all measures reasonable and appropriate to protect such Confidential Information.  
b) **Severability**: If any phrase, clause, sentence, or other provision contained in these Standard Carrier T&C’s, or any Award, agreement, or purchase order shall violate any applicable statute, ordinance, rule, or law, are deemed inoperative or unenforceable then the same shall be deemed severed here, to the extent of such violation; provided, however, that the remainder of these Standard Carrier T&C’s, or any Award, agreement, or purchase order shall remain in effect.  
c) **Notices**: Except as specifically provided herein, any notices required hereunder shall become effective when delivered personally or sent by registered mail, certified mail, or overnight courier service to the Parties at their respective addresses. Notice shall be deemed given upon personal delivery or on the receipt of registered, certified, or overnight mail. Notices to Niagara shall be sent to: Niagara Bottling, LLC, 2560 E. Philadelphia Street, Ontario, California 91761, Attn: Vice President of Legal Affairs and via email to panderson@niagarawater.com.  
d) **Anti-Kickback**: Carrier will not make any payment or transfer anything of value, directly or indirectly, to any employee of Niagara. It is the intent of the parties that no payments or transfers of anything of value shall be made which may have the purpose or effect (real or perceived) of bribery, acceptance of or acquiescence in kickbacks or other improper means of obtaining business.  
e) **Inspection**: Upon request by Niagara, any duly authorized representative of Niagara shall, until two (2) years after final payment under an Award, agreement, or purchase order between the Parties, have access to and right to examine directly pertinent books, papers, documents, accounts, and records of Carrier involving transactions between the Parties.  
f) **Independent Contractor**: Carrier shall act as an independent contractor and not as an agent or employee of Niagara.  
g) **Mitigation of Damages**: In the event that Carrier is unable to perform any obligation, in whole or in part, under any Award, agreement, or purchase order between the Parties, Niagara shall be entitled to purchase the requisite Transportation Services from another available source and Carrier will be liable for any additional costs incurred by Niagara.  
h) **Force Majeure**: In the event of storms, acts of God, riots, civil insurrection, flood, strike, war, or any other force majeure event that reduces or otherwise limits Carrier’s Transportation Service or delivery capabilities, Carrier shall use best efforts to meet its commitments to Niagara in accordance with any Award, agreement, or purchase order.  
i) These Standard Carrier T&C’s and/or any Award, agreement, or purchase order shall exclusively govern any relationship between Niagara and Carrier. To the extent that there is any conflict between these Standard Carrier T&C’s and/or any Award, agreement, or purchase order, these Standard Carrier T&C’s shall control. Any additional or contrary terms set forth in any of the Parties’ purchase orders, bills of lading, invoices, or other documentation shall have no force or effect.  
j) **Applicable Law**: These Standard Carrier T&C’s and/or any Award, agreement, or purchase order shall be interpreted under the laws of the State of California. Any action arising out of or related to these Standard Carrier T&C’s and/or any Award, agreement, or purchase order between the Parties or any of the dealings between the Parties hereto shall be brought and venued in the State or Federal courts located in San Bernardino County, California.  
k) **Dispute Resolution**: In the event of any dispute arising out of or related to these Standard Carrier T&C’s and/or any Award, agreement, or purchase order between the Parties, the Parties shall make a good faith effort, within thirty (30) days of such dispute, to meet in person to discuss potential amicable resolution of this dispute. During this time, where the Parties are exploring resolution of the dispute, Niagara shall not be in breach due to nonpayment of any invoice. This provision shall not be interpreted to release, postpone, or alter any of Carrier’s obligations set forth herein.  
l) **Attorneys’ Fees**: In the event a dispute cannot be resolved with respect to these Standard Carrier T&C’s and/or any Award, agreement, or purchase order between the Parties or the Transportation Services contemplated herein, the prevailing Party in such dispute shall be entitled to recover all actual and reasonable expenses including, without limitation, reasonable attorneys’ fees and expenses incurred in ascertaining such Party’s rights in preparing to enforce, or enforcing such Party’s rights under these Standard Carrier T&C’s and/or any Award, agreement, or purchase, whether or not it was necessary for such party to institute a suit in a court of law.

**Accessorial Terms**  
The following shall apply to all Awards and agreements between the Parties for Transportation Services:  
a) **On-Time Requirement**: In the event that Carrier’s driver arrives between the window of thirty (30) minutes before or thirty (30) minutes after any pick-up appointment, Niagara shall check-in and Load Carrier’s trailer. If Carrier’s driver arrives between the window of thirty-one (31) minutes to two (2) hours after any pick-up appointment, no accessorial charges or fees will be owed by Niagara, and Niagara will make commercially reasonable efforts to check-in and Load Carrier’s trailer. In the event that Carrier’s driver arrives at any pick-up appointment over two (2) hours late, no accessorial charges or fees shall be paid by Niagara to Carrier, and Niagara may, at its sole discretion, reject and not Load the trailer, and assess no-show charges against Carrier.  
b) **Free Wait Time**: Two (2) hours of free waiting time will be honored by the Carrier at both origin and destination.  
c) **Detention Rates**: Niagara shall pay detention rates for pick-up from Niagara facility or delivery to Niagara’s customer at a rate not to exceed $50/hour after two (2) hours of free waiting time, which shall not exceed a total of $250.00 per day. Detention rates on all invoices must correspond with Niagara’s BOL in and out times and be evidenced by both in and out times and show the location in which the charges were accrued. No detention rate shall be owed if Carrier is more than thirty (30) minutes late for its pick-up or delivery appointment.  
d) **Drop Trailer Detention**: In the event that Carrier’s trailer has been dropped at Niagara’s customer location and has not been unloaded by the customer within forty-eight (48) hours, Carrier shall immediately notify Niagara. Upon notification to Niagara, Niagara shall have twenty-four (24) hours to resolve the issue and Carrier agrees not to charge Niagara with any fees or penalties. In the event Carrier’s trailer is not released after this time period, Niagara agrees to pay Carrier a drop trailer detention rate not to exceed $40 per day. Carrier shall monitor the status of any detained trailer and provide Niagara with daily notifications as to the status of such detained trailer via email to executionteam@niagarawater.com. Release of a trailer shall immediately end all drop trailer detention rate charges to Niagara. Carrier shall invoice Niagara separately for any drop trailer detention rates. Carrier will agree to communicate any potential issue leading to an accessorial charge at the time an incident occurs in order to allow Niagara an opportunity to resolve the issue. All accessorial charges requested 24 hours after an incident has occurred will not be approved. Niagara will have the sole discretion to approve any accessorial charges caused by weather or force majeure.  
e) **Stop-off Charges**: Not to exceed $50.00 per additional stop.  
f) **Layover Charges**: Not to exceed $250.00 per day.  
g) In no event shall Carrier be able to charge Niagara both a detention charge and a layover charge, nor shall Carrier charge Niagara both detention and TONU charges.  
h) **Truck Order Not Used (“TONU”)**: TONU charge shall not exceed $250. In no event will the TONU charge exceed the cost of the products being transported. Carrier agrees that it shall not issue any TONU charges if 1) Carrier’s driver leaves the pick-up location on his own accord, 2) if Carrier tells its driver to leave the pick-up location without contacting and coordinating a pick-up appointment with Niagara, or 3) if Carrier’s driver arrives more than thirty (30) minutes after their scheduled pick-up appointment time.  
i) **No Show Charge**: If Carrier fails to pick up a tender that Carrier previously accepted and fails to notify Niagara at least 12 hours prior to the scheduled pick-up time, then Niagara may charge Carrier a no-show charge in the amount of $150 dollars or deduct the same from Carrier’s account with reference to the purchase order number for the tender of the Load.  
j) **Lumper**: If Carrier is prohibited from unloading a trailer and the Customer requires the hiring of a Lumper, Niagara agrees to reimburse Carrier for any Lumper, provided Carrier provides the Lumper receipt for the exact amount charged by the lumper service, with no markup, to each invoice referencing the corresponding purchase order number.  
k) **Driver Assist**: If Niagara’s customer is requiring Carrier to unload via driver assist, the charge will not exceed $50 per Load.  
l) **Re-Delivery**: In the event Niagara’s customer rejects or refuses delivery of a Load due to the fault of the Carrier, such as arriving late for the delivery appointment, Carrier must redeliver the Load at no further cost or expense to Niagara. In the event Niagara’s customer rejects or refuses delivery of a Load due to no fault of Carrier, Carrier agrees to redeliver the Load at a cost equal to or less than the cost of initial delivery. Carrier agrees to make every attempt to hold the Load in close proximity to Niagara’s customer’s delivery location.  
m) **Diversion Charges**: In the event that Carrier attempts to deliver to a location as specified by Niagara, and the Load is rejected, Niagara reserves the right to divert Carrier’s driver to another customer location within 150 miles of the original delivery location. Niagara shall pay diversion costs in accordance with the following chart:

| Distance from Original Location in miles | Diversion Rate to be Paid to Carrier (in US Dollars) |
|------------------------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------|
| 0-25                                    | $50                                                 |
| 26-50                                   | $100                                                |
| 51-100                                  | $200                                                |
| 101-150                                 | $250                                                |

Hereinafter, “Broker” and “Carrier” shall collectively be referred to as “Carrier.” “Lanes” shall mean movement of a load from Niagara’s facility to Niagara’s customer’s facility, as specified by Niagara. “Load” shall mean a single truckload. “Transportation Services” shall mean motor carrier services provided by Carrier for the transport, hauling, or delivery of any commodity, including finished products, pallets, or Loads. “Award” shall mean document from Niagara to Carrier, signed by Carrier notifying Carrier of any Lane or Load awarded to Carrier, and Carrier’s acceptance of such an award. “Party” or “Parties” shall mean Niagara or Carrier individually or collectively.

**Pricing**  
During the term as set forth by Niagara in its sole discretion, as described in any Award or agreement, Carrier agrees only to charge the rates set forth by Niagara (“Base Rate”) for the Transportation Services in Lanes and/or Loads as requested by Niagara as full and complete compensation for the Transportation Services being provided by Carrier. Should Niagara provide an Award to Carrier for additional Lanes and/or Loads to provide Transportation Services to, such additional Award will be subject to these Standard Carrier T&C’s.

**Payment Terms**  
Prior to commencement of Transportation Services, and in order to receive payment from Niagara, Carrier must provide Niagara with a Certificate of Insurance (COI) in accordance with Section 16 herein. Carrier shall only invoice Niagara for awarded Lanes and/or Loads received from Niagara. Such invoice and all supporting documents shall be submitted promptly, following transport of any Load to Niagara via email at truckingbackup@niagarawater.com. Such invoices must include Carrier’s name and invoice number in the subject line. Each email shall only include one (1) invoice per email submission. Failure to comply with the terms of this section shall result in delay and/or non-payment of charges. Niagara will pay any undisputed portion of Carrier’s properly submitted invoice within thirty (30) days of receipt of invoice and supporting documentation. Any and all payments by Niagara shall be deemed effective as of the date of postmark. Niagara shall have no liability for invoices that are not received within ninety (90) days of transport of any Load. Niagara shall have no liability for added, balance due, accessorial, or any other charges of any nature which are not provided by the Award and which are not submitted within ninety (90) days from the date of transport of a Load. Carrier agrees to apply payment to the amount due for the specified invoice regardless of whether there are earlier unpaid invoices. In the event any payment becomes overdue, Carrier shall provide written notice to nonpayment via certified mail to: Attn: Vice President of Legal Affairs, Niagara Bottling, LLC, 2560 E. Philadelphia Street, Ontario, California 91761. Carrier shall also notify Niagara by sending emails to the following: Debra Morrison at dmorrison@niagarawater.com and transprocurement@niagarawater.com. Upon actual receipt of certified mail notice, Niagara shall have ten (10) days to cure any late payment. At no time during this cure period will Niagara be deemed in breach. In the event of timely cure by Niagara, Niagara shall not be deemed in breach and shall not be charged any late charges, late fees, penalties, or interest. In no event shall Carrier have a lien on any of Niagara’s Loads, products, or finished goods to secure payment of any invoices or charges. Carrier agrees to comply with all technological requirements of Niagara and its customers, including but not limited to 100% transactional compliance and specifically 204-Load Tender, 210-Carrier Invoice, 214-Shipment Status, and 990-Load Tender Response. Carrier shall be solely responsible for any and all costs for and associated with such technology.

**Award Acceptance**  
Once Carrier signs and accepts any Award, Carrier agrees to transport a minimum of 99% of any tender offers for such Lane(s). If Carrier falls below this 99% threshold, Carrier agrees to be liable for all damages arising due to Carrier’s failure, plus a fee equal to 4% of Carrier’s Base Rate. Such damages include, but are not limited to, costs incurred by Niagara in excess of the Base Rate to secure delivery of any Loads described in such tender offer by a third-party carrier. Should Niagara subsequently offer tenders for Loads not included in the Award or agreement and Carrier agrees to transport such Loads, Carrier agrees to transport such Load at the same rates as the delivery of Loads in the Award unless otherwise agreed to in writing by the Parties. Carrier must notify Niagara within ninety (90) minutes of receipt of Niagara’s tender offer that Carrier has: (a) received the tender offer; and (b) confirmed that it will transport the Load.

**Carrier Performance**  
Carrier understands that all Transportation Services must be performed in a timely fashion. Carrier is solely responsible for scheduling and complying with any and all deliveries and delivery times as requested by Niagara’s customers.  
a) **Pick-up of Loads**: Carrier shall maintain a monthly on-time pick-up appointment rate of a minimum of 90% from the designated Niagara facility through the entire term of the Award. If Carrier’s monthly pick-up rate falls below 90%, Carrier agrees to a $50 fee for every late pick-up appointment for the previous month that caused Carrier to fall below the 90% pick-up rate.  
b) **Delivery of Loads**: Carrier shall maintain a 98% monthly rate for on-time delivery of Loads through the entire term of the Award. On-time delivery of Loads shall mean Loads delivered within thirty (30) minutes of a scheduled delivery appointment time. If Carrier’s monthly on-time delivery rate to Niagara or its customer’s locations falls below 98%, Carrier agrees to a $100 fee for every late and/or missed delivery appointment for the previous month that caused Carrier to fall below the 98% delivery rate.  
c) **Payload**: Carrier warrants that it has the ability to ship Loads that are 45,600 pounds or less. Niagara may scale and weigh all Loads and shall provide a pallet count for all Loads. In accepting any Load, Carrier agrees to count all pallet quantities prior to sealing the trailer. Niagara will make its best effort to produce a tactical forecast of the projected volume of Loads and weights for the upcoming month. In the event Niagara requests Carrier to haul 20% more of its projected daily volume, Carrier shall comply with such a request. In the event Carrier is unable to haul Niagara’s scale and weighted Load, causing Niagara to remove any products or pallets, Carrier agrees that Niagara may deduct a fee of $100 per occurrence from Carrier’s corresponding purchase order.  
d) **Equipment**: Carrier shall ensure that all equipment used in connection with performing Transportation Services be clean, odor-free, dry, leak-proof, and free of contamination and/or infestation. Carrier warrants that no motor vehicle, trailer, tractor, or other equipment that will be used for Transportation Services for Niagara has been used to transport refuse, garbage, trash, or solid or liquid waste of any kind, or any types of hazardous materials. Carrier agrees that any breach of this provision may result in substantial harm to Niagara’s products and/or customers and may have a detrimental effect on Niagara’s reputation and image in the marketplace, product integrity, and goodwill. Niagara may, at its sole discretion, reject any and all trailers for issues including, but not limited to, odors, debris from prior shipment, or lack of structural integrity. Carriers shall not be permitted more than a 1% trailer rejection rate per month.  
e) **Operation**: Carrier shall ensure and bear all costs and expenses related to the operation of its motor vehicles, trailers, tractors, and equipment (“Carrier Equipment”), including ensuring that only fully qualified and licensed personnel operate any Carrier Equipment in accordance with, or as required by all applicable local, state, and/or federal laws, regulations, and authorities.  
f) **Customer Service**: Carrier, at its sole expense, must maintain and make available a telephone line for customer service to Niagara. Such customer service line will be operational twenty-four hours a day, seven days a week, and shall respond within thirty (30) minutes of contact by Niagara.

**Documentation**  
With respect to the following documents, Carrier agrees to maintain the documents as follows:  
a) **Daily reports**: Carrier shall provide Niagara daily reports regarding the status of all Loads and delivery times;  
b) **Proof of Delivery (POD)**: Carrier shall provide Niagara free of charge with any and all PODs within 48 hours of delivery of any Load and shall maintain all such PODs for at least twelve (12) months from the date of delivery, or for a period as proscribed by law;  
c) **Bill of Lading (BOL)**: Carrier agrees that Niagara’s bill of lading shall be considered: (i) an acceptable form of receipt hereunder, and (ii) specific shipping instructions. These Standard Carrier T&C’s shall be incorporated by reference into each and every such BOL and in the event of an inconsistency, these Standard Carrier T&C’s shall control;  
d) **Supporting documents for Accessorial charges**: Carrier agrees to provide all documents in accordance with Section 18 of these Standard Terms and Conditions.

**Carrier Failure to provide Proof of Delivery (POD)**  
In the event Carrier fails to provide a POD within 48 hours of delivery, Niagara shall have the right to deduct all amounts paid for Transportation Services or demand payment for the amount of the Transportation Service invoice. Additionally, if Carrier cannot provide the POD within fourteen (14) days of delivery, Niagara may charge Carrier for the cost of any of Niagara’s customer’s invoice for product not paid. Alternatively, if Niagara receives a refusal to pay for a Load from its customer, Niagara will provide Carrier with evidence of customer refusal and proof of loss and shall charge Carrier the cost of the customer’s invoice for the product.

**Assignment and Subcontracting**  
Carrier agrees not to interline, use other motor carriers or brokers, or to use “substituted services” or otherwise assign or subcontract any portion of any Award, agreement, or purchase order without the express written consent of Niagara. If, with the express written permission of Niagara, Carrier elects to use a delivery agent or subcontract the transportation of a Load, Carrier shall be the sole bearer of any costs associated with the delivery agent or subcontractor and agrees to be fully liable for any loss, damage, or delay to transportation of any such Loads while in this third-party carrier’s care, custody, and/or control. Carrier understands and agrees that all payments made by Niagara are conditioned upon Niagara’s receipt of a conditional waiver and release executed by Carrier and an unconditional waiver and release executed by each Additional Party. Carrier agrees to defend, indemnify, and hold Niagara and its customers harmless from any and all claims of any Additional Party for payment. Carrier acknowledges and agrees that Carrier shall remain, at all times, fully liable for all Additional Parties. Carrier warrants that it shall ensure that Additional Parties comply with and adhere to all warranties, representations, obligations, terms, and conditions contained herein.

**Compliance with Law**  
At all times during the Award or agreement term or its relationship with Niagara, Carrier shall comply with all applicable state and federal laws. Additionally, Carrier shall operate all Carrier Equipment in compliance with industry standards and shall maintain and operate the same such that Carrier’s safety rating does not fall below “satisfactory” under the Federal Motor Carrier Safety Administration standards. In the event that Carrier’s safety rating falls below “satisfactory,” Carrier shall notify Niagara immediately, and Niagara will have the immediate right to terminate any Award, agreement, or purchase order upon notice to Carrier.

**Indemnification**  
a) Carrier agrees to indemnify, defend, and hold Niagara, its affiliates, and representatives harmless from and against any and all claims arising out of or related to any Award, agreement, or purchase order and/or Transportation Services that are the subject thereof, including but not limited to: (i) any bodily injury or property damage claims, and any liability, loss, cost, expense, or other damages (including reasonable attorney fees) brought about by any injury of any kind suffered by any person or property as a result of any act, neglect, default, omission of either the Carrier, Carrier’s agents, employees, affiliates, subcontractors, or any third party for whose actions Carrier is responsible (“Carrier Actors”), or Niagara, Niagara’s agents, employees, affiliates, subcontractors, or other representatives; (ii) any negligent act, misfeasance, or nonfeasance by Carrier, or Carrier Actors; (iii) any harm, injury, damage, or loss arising out of or in connection with the Transportation Services provided; (iv) third-party consumer claims, suits, and/or demands, including costs and expenses of investigation and settlement and attorneys’ fees and expenses, to the extent such claims arise from: (a) any act or omission by Carrier or Carrier Actors relating to or affecting the condition, quality, or character of any Goods or Services provided; or (b) trademark, copyright, trade dress, or patent infringement. Carrier acknowledges and agrees that Carrier must receive Niagara’s express written approval prior to settling any claim or lawsuit. Niagara reserves the right at any time to control its own defense.  
b) Should Carrier receive (or become aware of) any demand, service of process, notice, action, settlement, summons, complaint, or the like from or by a third party alleging that a Party hereto is responsible for some injury, act, omission, breach, negligence, claim, loss, violation of law, settlement, cost, expense, obligation, liability, damage, recovery, deficiency, or otherwise, including, without limitation, interest, penalties, reasonable attorney fees, and costs (each, a “Claim”) that arises out of, results from, or in any way relates to the subject matter of these Standard Terms and Conditions, an Award, agreement, or purchase order, then Carrier shall immediately (but no later than five (5) business days after receipt, or becoming aware, of a third-party Claim) provide Niagara with written notice regarding each third-party Claim of which Carrier is or becomes aware. Carrier covenants and agrees that should Carrier fail to provide Niagara with timely written notice regarding any third-party Claim, Carrier hereby generally and expressly waives, relinquishes, and releases, and agrees to hold harmless, Niagara from and against any and all Claims capable of being asserted by Carrier against Niagara in connection therewith.  
c) In the event Carrier utilizes any party (“Additional Party”) regardless of that party’s legal designation of contractor, subcontractor, materials supplier, agent, or otherwise, for the purpose of performing any Transportation Services, Carrier shall submit to Niagara written notice of (i) each Additional Party, (ii) the duties each Additional Party will undertake, (iii) the amount of compensation each Additional Party is to receive from Carrier, and (iv) Carrier’s compensation schedule and payment terms with the Additional Party. Carrier understands submitting this written notice as set forth above is a condition precedent to payment. Such written notice must be sent to Vice President of Legal Affairs via email and certified mail (1) panderson@niagarawater.com, (2) 2560 E. Philadelphia St., Ontario, CA 91761.  
g) **Waiver**: Niagara’s delay, failure, or partial exercise of any provision herein or waiver of any breach, right, or remedy contained in or granted by any Award, agreement, or purchase order shall not be deemed a waiver of any breach, right, or remedy unless expressly stated as such by Niagara in writing signed by an authorized representative of Niagara, and then such waiver shall be limited solely to its specific terms.

**Limitation of Liability**  
In no event shall Niagara be liable for any punitive, exemplary, special, incidental, indirect, or consequential damages of any kind (including, but not limited to loss of profits, loss of reputation, and/or loss of current or prospective business advantage, when where such losses are characterized as direct damages) arising out of or in any way related to the relationship and/or dealings between Niagara and Carrier regardless of whether the claim under which damages are sought is based upon contract, tort, negligence, strict liability, or otherwise, and regardless of whether the parties have been advised of the possibility of such damages at the time of contracting or otherwise. Under no circumstances shall Niagara’s maximum total liability, if any, arising out of or in any way related to the relationship and/or dealings between Niagara and Carrier exceed the amounts paid and/or due to Carrier by Niagara under any relationship between the Parties, Award, agreement, or purchase order.

**Liability for Loss, Damage, or Delay to Loads**  
a) Carrier agrees that in the transportation of all Loads hereunder, it shall assume, and does assume, the liability of an interstate motor carrier, as provided by 49 U.S.C. § 14706, with such liability to exist from the time of the receipt of any of said goods by Carrier until proper delivery has been made to the location specified by Niagara. The Parties expressly decline to limit the value of the property as permitted by 49 U.S.C. § 14706(c). All claims will be filed and resolved in accordance with the ICC regulations in 49 CFR Part 370.  
b) All Loads tendered to Carrier for transportation will be palletized and stretch-wrapped. Carrier reserves the right to refuse to accept any Load that is not so packaged.  
c) Parties agree that each incident of transportation of product under any Award, agreement, or purchase order shall be evidenced by a BOL signed by Carrier and Niagara showing the kind, quantity, value, and condition of products or goods received and delivered by Carrier at the loading and unloading points respectively. Carrier’s duties and responsibilities under any Award, agreement, or purchase order between the Parties for the transport of any Load evidenced by such receipt shall commence when Carrier takes possession and control of Niagara’s property or upon execution of such receipt by Niagara, whichever occurs first, and shall end when consignee/customer/buyer signs a delivery receipt and Carrier delivers Niagara’s property. Carrier shall inspect all Loads prior to accepting possession and control and shall document any evidence of damage on the BOL. If Carrier does not indicate damage on the BOL at the time of possession and immediately communicates the existence of such damage to Niagara, Carrier agrees that damage documented upon delivery presumptively occurred while the Load was in Carrier’s custody and possession.  
d) The time limit within which Niagara must file a claim for damaged or lost products or goods against Carrier shall be nine (9) months from the date of delivery or within nine (9) months of the reasonably anticipated date of delivery in the event of a complete loss. All claims shall be paid, settled, or disallowed by Carrier within ninety (90) days of filing. Disallowance shall state a lawful reason for declining to accept responsibility for the claim and shall be stated by Carrier, not its insurer. In no event shall Niagara be required to work with Carrier’s insurer directly. Niagara agrees to immediately provide written notice of claim to Carrier showing kind, quantity, value, and proof of carriage as evidenced by a signed BOL.  
e) In the event of Carrier’s breach, or alleged breach, as determined solely by Niagara, of any provision in any Award, agreement, or purchase order between the Parties, in addition to all other remedies in law or equity that are available to Niagara, Carrier shall be responsible for all reasonable attorneys’ fees and costs incurred by Niagara as a result of said breach or alleged breach.

**Product Loss or Damage**  
a) **Rejected Load**: In the event the Niagara’s customer rejects the delivery of any Load due to the fault of Carrier, Carrier must return the Load to the pick-up origin designated by Niagara at no cost. In the event Niagara’s customer rejects the delivery of a Load due to no fault of the Carrier, Niagara shall pay a transportation rate equal to the rate Niagara paid Carrier to transport the Load to Niagara’s customer. Any and all rejected Loads not scheduled for redelivery must be delivered back to Niagara’s pick-up origin within five (5) days from the time/date of initial pick-up. Any Load being transported back to Niagara’s pick-up origin must be secured with either a seal or padlock and a confirmation must be sent via email to executionteam@niagarawater.com. Return charges for short-haul clusters will be returned at half the published rate of the Load. For long-haul cluster freight, return charges will not exceed the total all-in rate of the Load.  
b) **Visual Damage to Products**: For damages to individual cases of product up to less than one pallet, Niagara’s customer must note the damage on the BOL, and customer or Carrier may dispose of or donate damaged cases of product. For damage to one or more pallets, Niagara’s customer must note the damage on the BOL. If the Load is rejected and remains in the custody of Carrier, Carrier must immediately contact Niagara Dispatch for deposition instructions. Carrier must provide the purchase order number, date and time of single delivery, number of pallets damaged and/or refused, bottle code, any photographs, a brief description of the damage, and contact information, including contact name, phone number, email, and facsimile number.  
c) **Concealed Damage to Products**: If Niagara’s customer reports concealed damage to the product, pallet, and/or Load, such damage will be investigated to determine liability. If the investigation concludes that Carrier is responsible for the damage, Carrier will be notified of Niagara’s intent to file a claim and will be given the opportunity to inspect the product, pallet, or Load prior to disposition for disposal or donation.  
d) **Product Loss/Delay**: In the event Carrier is unable to execute delivery for reasons such as theft of Load, vehicular accident, or delay impacting the product’s integrity (i.e., non-delivery of Load/products to its specified destination within five (5) calendar days), recovery of loss will be executed pursuant to 49 CFR 370.  
e) **Donation/Disposal**: Due to product liability, trademark protection, and/or licensing agreements for private label stock, any distressed, damaged, or otherwise rejected shipment that is not returned to a Niagara facility, for whatever reason, must be properly disposed of or donated in accordance with Niagara’s express written instruction. IN NO CIRCUMSTANCE CAN ANY GOODS, PRODUCTS, OR INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY EVER BE RE-SOLD. Carrier understands and agrees that in no event shall Carrier nor any Carrier Actors, without the prior express written consent of Niagara: (i) cause, suffer or permit the transfer, salvage, disposal, and/or donation of any Goods, Products, or Intellectual Property, and/or (ii) offer to transfer, salvage, dispose of, and/or donate any Goods, Products, or Intellectual Property, whether as salvage or otherwise. Notwithstanding the foregoing, if there is a distressed, damaged, or otherwise rejected Load of product that is not returned to a Niagara facility, and Niagara gives express written permission to a Carrier to dispose of or donate the goods or products, Niagara shall require written verification, signed by the Carrier’s authorized agent, which provides exact details as to the final disposition as well as copies of donation/disposal receipts as backup.  
f) **Claim Settlement**: In order to close a freight claim as settled, one of the following conclusions must be obtained:  
- Granted: paid in full  
- Declined: written declination including a specific legal reason  
- Compromised: written offer to settle for less than the original claim amount, including legal rationale for the offer to pay less than the full amount claimed  

g) **Payment**: Any and all payments from Carrier to Niagara in settlement of a claim must be made, in full, and sent to:  
Niagara Bottling, LLC  
2560 E. Philadelphia Street  
Ontario, CA 91761  
Attention: Claims Specialist  
Niagara’s claim reference number must appear on the check. A partial payment check will not be accepted and will not be cashed as a granted or settled claim.

**Seals**  
Carrier agrees to comply with the Food and Drug Administration and industry standards with regard to seals as codified in FDA 21 CFR 110.93, which states that all transportation of food shall be under conditions to protect that food. Storage and transportation of finished food shall be under conditions that will protect the food against physical, chemical, and microbial contamination as well as against deterioration of the food and the container. Carrier further agrees to use standard industry practices, including, but not limited to ensuring that any and all trailers from or on behalf of Niagara will be kept sealed while transporting all goods. Carrier must confirm that the seal has been secured on the trailer and that the seal number is recorded on the BOL by Niagara prior to leaving any of Niagara’s facilities. If the seal is required to be broken at any time during transport, Carrier must first seek Niagara’s authorization. Carrier must then notify Niagara that the trailer has been re-sealed by sending an email to executionteam@niagarawater.com. In the event Niagara’s customer breaks the seal, rejects the Load, and does not provide Carrier with a new seal to re-seal the trailer, Niagara’s customer or Carrier must add a lock to the trailer to secure the Load. It is Carrier’s sole responsibility to ensure that the trailer is re-sealed or a lock is added to the trailer prior to leaving Niagara’s customer’s facilities. No Loads will be accepted by Niagara without a seal or lock on the trailer.

**Insurance**  
During the term of all Awards, agreements, or purchase orders, and after any termination of or expiration, and for as long as Carrier owes any obligation to Niagara and/or any statute of limitations for any potential claim that Niagara may have against Carrier remains unexpired, Carrier and any Carrier Actors shall maintain all insurance and/or bonds required by statute, law, and any Award, agreement, or purchase order with minimum insurance limits consistent with Niagara’s insurance requirements set forth at the end of this Section 16. Should insurance policy limits be exhausted or should Carrier or any Carrier Actors fail to maintain the required insurance coverage, neither Carrier nor any Carrier Actor will in any way be relieved from liability provided for herein to Niagara should a loss occur. Carrier shall furnish Niagara with a certificate evidencing the aforementioned coverage limits via email to insurancecerts@niagarawater.com. Such certificate shall provide for thirty (30) days written notice to Niagara in the event of cancellation. All certificates of insurance shall name Niagara Bottling, LLC and its parents, subsidiaries, employees, agents, affiliates, and assigns as an additional insured by policy endorsement (on both Carrier’s General Liability Policy, Automobile Liability Policy, and Cargo Insurance Policy) and waive all rights of subrogation against Niagara, its parent, director, officers, employees, stockholders, subsidiaries, and affiliates with regard to Employee Liability and Workers Compensation. For any claims relating to an Agreement, agreement, or purchase order, the Carrier’s insurance shall be deemed to be primary and not contributing to or in excess of any similar coverage purchased by Niagara. Carrier hereby acknowledges that naming Niagara Bottling, LLC and its parents, subsidiaries, employees, agents, affiliates, and assigns as an additional insured by policy endorsement is a condition precedent to payment by Niagara. For the avoidance of doubt, Niagara will not be required to submit payment until the requirements of this provision have been met. However, failure of Niagara to demand any certificates or to identify any deficiency in the insurance provided shall not be construed as or deemed to be a waiver of the Carrier’s (or its agents or subcontractors) obligation to maintain such insurance. If any of the coverages are required to remain in force after termination of the Agreement, Carrier shall submit additional certificates evidencing continuation of coverage until such obligation ends.  

**Niagara’s Minimum Insurance Requirements**:  
- Commercial General Liability: $2,000,000 per occurrence; $5,000,000 aggregate  
- Auto Liability: $3,000,000 combined single limit  
- Cargo: $100,000  
- Employee Liability/Workman’s Comp: $2,000,000/Statutory  

In addition to the general insurance requirements provided in the above table, customized insurance requirements for specific Seller-types are attached hereto and incorporated herein by this reference.

**Termination**  
a) Any Award, agreement, or purchase order shall commence on the date such Award is given, agreement is entered into, or purchase order is issued, and shall automatically renew on a year-to-year basis until terminated, provided that Carrier is performing in accordance with these Carrier Standard T&C’s, the Award, agreement, or purchase order, and that Carrier continues to provide Niagara the lowest available rates in the market and the lowest rates and/or most favorable terms at which Carrier offers its service to any third-party shipper in the same functional level of the trade as Niagara (“Most Favorable Rates”). The Parties agree to meet in good faith to discuss existing rates at a time no earlier than twelve (12) months after the Award is issued or an agreement is entered into by the Parties. Such discussions may result in a rate adjustment if, and only if, the adjustment is in reference to driver pay, and only upon mutual written consent by both Parties. Notwithstanding the foregoing, Carrier guarantees that any rate increase will not exceed 2% of the current rate. In the event that Carrier does not provide Niagara with the Most Favorable Rates, Niagara shall have the right to terminate by giving thirty (30) days written notice to Carrier.  
b) If during the term specified by any Award, agreement, or purchase order either party (i) files a petition in bankruptcy or has a petition in bankruptcy filed against it that is not dismissed within sixty (60) days, or (ii) makes a general assignment for the benefit of creditors, then in any such case the non-bankrupt party may terminate any Award, agreement, or purchase order by giving written notice of such effect to the bankrupt party.  
c) If all or any portion of Carrier’s registration, as required by any Award, agreement, or purchase order, is revoked, canceled, suspended, or discontinued by operation of law or otherwise (“Registration Issue”), or if Carrier’s insurance policies are canceled, reduced, or otherwise invalidated (“Insurance Issue”), Carrier shall promptly notify Niagara, and in no case later than forty-eight (48) hours after Carrier learns of any such Registration or Insurance Issue and Niagara shall have the right to terminate any Award, agreement, or purchase order immediately and/or collect reimbursement for all expenses it has incurred in preparation of and/or as a result of any Award, agreement, or purchase order from Carrier. Carrier’s notification to Niagara in regards to the above shall in no way serve as a waiver by Niagara of its right to construe such as a breach of any Award, agreement, or purchase order and shall in no way limit Niagara’s right to pursue all remedies in law or equity as a result of such breach.  
d) If, in Niagara’s sole discretion, delays in transportation cause inconvenience and/or harm to Niagara’s business interests, or Carrier is otherwise in breach of any Award, agreement, or purchase order, Niagara shall provide written notice to Carrier outlining the delay and resulting or anticipated harm and/or breach. If the deficiencies and/or breach remain following a period of thirty (30) days from the date written notice was provided, as is measured as of the date specified on the notice, Niagara may terminate any Award, agreement, or purchase order upon thirty (30) days written notice to Carrier.  
e) In the event of any discontinuation and/or revision to any regulations and/or laws in the United States (or any other country where Carrier services Niagara), and/or if Niagara, in its sole discretion, determines that the services contemplated in any Award, agreement, or purchase order are no longer necessary or required and/or that Niagara’s course of business strategy has changed, Niagara may terminate any Award, agreement, or purchase order in part or in its entirety upon sixty (60) days’ notice to Carrier.  
f) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary herein, Niagara shall have the ability to terminate any Award, agreement, or purchase order for convenience with a sixty (60) day written notice, and Carrier shall have the ability to terminate any Award or agreement with one hundred eighty (180) day written notice to Niagara.

**General Provisions**  
a) **Confidentiality**: Throughout the term of any Award, agreement, or purchase order between the Parties, the Parties may come into possession of information or data which constitute trade secrets, know-how, confidential information, or are otherwise considered to be secret (hereinafter “Confidential Information”).

**Accessorial Terms**  
The following shall apply to all Awards and agreements between the Parties for Transportation Services:  
a) **On-Time Requirement**: In the event that Carrier’s driver arrives between the window of thirty (30) minutes before or thirty (30) minutes after any pick-up appointment, Niagara shall check-in and Load Carrier’s trailer. If Carrier’s driver arrives between the window of thirty-one (31) minutes to two (2) hours after any pick-up appointment, no accessorial charges or fees will be owed by Niagara, and Niagara will make commercially reasonable efforts to check-in and Load Carrier’s trailer. In the event that Carrier’s driver arrives to any pick-up appointment over two (2) hours late, no accessorial charges or fees will be paid by Niagara to Carrier, and Niagara may, at its sole discretion, reject and not Load the trailer, and assess no-show charges against Carrier.  
b) **Free Wait Time**: Two (2) hours of free waiting time will be honored by the Carrier at both origin and destination.

e) **Stop-off Charges**: Not to exceed $50.00 per additional stop.  
f) **Layover Charges**: Not to exceed $250.00 per day.  
g) In no event shall Carrier be able to charge Niagara both a detention charge and a layover charge, nor shall Carrier charge Niagara both detention and TONU charges.  
h) **Truck Order Not Used (“TONU”)**: TONU charge shall not exceed $250. In no event will TONU charge exceed the cost of the products being transported.

i) **No Show Charge**: If Carrier fails to pick up a tender that Carrier previously accepted and fails to notify Niagara at least 12 hours prior to the scheduled pick-up time, then Niagara may charge Carrier a no-show charge in the amount of $150 dollars or deduct the same from Carrier’s account with reference to the purchase order number for the tender of the Load.  
j) **Lumper**: If Carrier is prohibited from unloading a trailer and Customer requires the hiring of a Lumper, Niagara agrees to reimburse Carrier for any Lumper, provided Carrier provides the Lumper receipt for the exact amount charged by the lumper service, with no markup, to each invoice referencing the corresponding purchase order number.  
k) **Driver Assist**: If Niagara’s customer is requiring Carrier to unload via driver assist, the charge will not exceed $50 per Load.  
l) **Re-Delivery**: In the event Niagara’s customer rejects or refuses delivery of a Load due to the fault of the Carrier, such as arriving late for delivery appointment, Carrier must redeliver the Load at no further cost or expense to Niagara. In the event Niagara’s customer rejects or refuses delivery of a Load due to no fault of Carrier, Carrier agrees to redeliver the Load at a cost equal to or less than the cost of initial delivery. Carrier agrees to make every attempt to hold the Load in close proximity to Niagara’s customer’s delivery location.  
m) **Diversion Charges**: In the event that Carrier attempts to deliver to a location as specified by Niagara, and the Load is rejected, Niagara reserves the right to divert Carrier’s driver to another customer location within 150 miles of the original delivery location. Niagara shall pay diversion costs in accordance with the following chart:

| Distance from Original Location in miles | Diversion Rate to be Paid to Carrier (in US Dollars) |

**Pricing**  
During the term as set forth by Niagara in its sole discretion, as described in any Award or agreement, Carrier agrees only to charge the rates set forth by Niagara (“Base Rate”) for the Transportation Services in Lanes and/or Loads as requested by Niagara as full and complete compensation for the Transportation Services being provided by Carrier. Should Niagara provide an Award to Carrier for additional Lanes and/or Loads to provide Transportation Services to, such additional Award will be subject to these Standard Carrier T&C’s.

**Payment Terms**  
Prior to commencement of Transportation Services, and in order to receive payment from Niagara, Carrier must provide Niagara with a Certificate of Insurance (COI) in accordance with Section 16 herein. Carrier shall only invoice Niagara for awarded Lanes and/or Loads received from Niagara. Such invoice and all supporting documents shall be submitted promptly, following transport of any Load to Niagara via email at truckingbackup@niagarawater.com. Such invoices must include Carrier’s name and invoice number in the subject line. Each email shall only include one (1) invoice per email submission. Failure to comply with the terms of this section shall result in delay and/or non-payment of charges. Niagara will pay any undisputed portion of Carrier’s properly submitted invoice within thirty (30) days of receipt of invoice and supporting documentation. Any and all payments by Niagara shall be deemed effective as of the date of postmark. Niagara shall have no liability for invoices that are not received within ninety (90) days of transport of any Load. Niagara shall have no liability for added, balance due, accessorial, or any other charges of any nature which are not provided by the Award and which are not submitted within ninety (90) days from the date of transport of a Load. Carrier agrees to apply payment to the amount due for the specified invoice regardless of whether there are earlier unpaid invoices. In the event any payment becomes overdue, Carrier shall provide written notice to nonpayment via certified mail to: Attn: Vice President of Legal Affairs, Niagara Bottling, LLC, 2560 E. Philadelphia Street, Ontario, California 91761. Carrier shall also notify Niagara by sending emails to the following: Debra Morrison at dmorrison@niagarawater.com and transprocurement@niagarawater.com. Upon actual receipt of certified mail notice, Niagara shall have ten (10) days to cure any late payment. At no time during this cure period will Niagara be deemed in breach. In the event of timely cure by Niagara, Niagara shall not be deemed in breach and shall not be charged any late charges, late fees, penalties, or interest. In no event shall Carrier have a lien on any of Niagara’s Loads, products, or finished goods to secure payment of any invoices or charges.

Carrier shall be solely responsible for any and all costs for and associated with such technology.

**Award Acceptance**  
Once Carrier signs and accepts any Award, Carrier agrees to transport a minimum of 99% of any tender offers for such Lane(s). If Carrier falls below this 99% threshold, Carrier agrees to be liable for all damages arising due to Carrier’s failure, plus a fee equal to 4% of Carrier’s Base Rate. Such damages include, but are not limited to, costs incurred by Niagara in excess of the Base Rate to secure delivery of any Loads described in such tender offer by a third-party carrier. Should Niagara subsequently offer tenders for Loads not included in the Award or agreement and Carrier agrees to transport such Loads, Carrier agrees to transport such Load at the same rates as the delivery of Loads in the Award unless otherwise agreed to in writing by the Parties. Carrier must notify Niagara within ninety (90) minutes of receipt of Niagara’s tender offer that Carrier has: (a) received the tender offer; and (b) confirm that it will transport the Load.

**Carrier Performance**  
Carrier understands that all Transportation Services must be performed in a timely fashion. Carrier is solely responsible for scheduling and complying with any and all deliveries and delivery times as requested by Niagara’s customers.  
a) **Pick-up of Loads**: Carrier shall maintain a monthly on-time pick-up appointment rate of a minimum of 90% from the designated Niagara facility through the entire term of the Award. If Carrier’s monthly pick-up rate falls below 90%, Carrier agrees to a $50 fee for every late pick-up appointment for the previous month that caused Carrier to fall below the 90% pick-up rate.  
b) **Delivery of Loads**: Carrier shall maintain a 98% monthly rate for on-time delivery of Loads through the entire term of the Award. On-time delivery of Loads shall mean Loads delivered within thirty (30) minutes of a scheduled delivery appointment time. If Carrier’s monthly on-time delivery rate to Niagara or its customer’s locations falls below 98%, Carrier agrees to a $100 fee for every late and/or missed delivery appointment for the previous month that caused Carrier to fall below the 98% delivery rate.  
c) **Payload**: Carrier warrants that it has the ability to ship Loads that are 45,600 pounds or less. Niagara may scale and weigh all Loads and shall provide a pallet count for all Loads. In accepting any Load, Carrier agrees to count all pallet quantities prior to sealing the trailer. Niagara will make its best effort to produce a tactical forecast of the projected volume of Loads and weights for the upcoming month. In the event Niagara requests Carrier to haul 20% more of its projected daily volume, Carrier shall comply with such a request. In the event Carrier is unable to haul Niagara’s scale and weighted Load, causing Niagara to remove any products or pallets, Carrier agrees that Niagara may deduct a fee of $100 per occurrence from Carrier’s corresponding purchase order.  
d) **Equipment**: Carrier shall ensure that all equipment used in connection with performing Transportation Services be clean, odor-free, dry, leak-proof, and free of contamination and/or infestation. Carrier warrants that no motor vehicle, trailer, tractor, or other equipment that will be used for Transportation Services for Niagara has been used to transport refuse, garbage, trash, or solid or liquid waste of any kind, or any types of hazardous materials. Carrier agrees that any breach of this provision may result in substantial harm to Niagara’s products and/or customers and may have a detrimental effect on Niagara’s reputation and image in the marketplace, product integrity, and goodwill. Niagara may, at its sole discretion, reject any and all trailers for issues including, but not limited to, odors, debris from prior shipment, or lack of structural integrity. Carriers shall not be permitted more than a 1% trailer rejection rate per month.  
e) **Operation**: Carrier shall ensure and bear all costs and expenses related to the operation of its motor vehicles, trailers, tractors, and equipment (“Carrier Equipment”), including ensuring that only fully qualified and licensed personnel operate any Carrier Equipment in accordance with, or as required by all applicable local, state, and/or federal laws, regulations, and authorities.  
f) **Customer Service**: Carrier, at its sole expense, must maintain and make available a telephone line for customer service to Niagara. Such customer service line will be operational twenty-four hours a day, seven days a week, and shall respond within thirty (30) minutes of contact by Niagara.

**Documentation**  
With respect to the following documents, Carrier agrees to maintain the documents as follows:  
a) **Daily reports**: Carrier shall provide Niagara daily reports regarding the status of all Loads and delivery times;  
b) **Proof of Delivery (POD)**: Carrier shall provide Niagara free of charge with any and all PODs within 48 hours of delivery of any Load and shall maintain all such PODs for at least twelve (12) months from the date of delivery, or for a period as proscribed by law;  
c) **Bill of Lading (BOL)**: Carrier agrees that Niagara’s bill of lading shall be considered: (i) an acceptable form of receipt hereunder, and (ii) specific shipping instructions. These Standard Carrier T&C’s shall be incorporated by reference into each and every such BOL and in the event of an inconsistency, these Standard Carrier T&C’s shall control;  
d) **Supporting documents for Accessorial charges**: Carrier agrees to provide all documents in accordance with Section 18 of these Standard Terms and Conditions.

**Carrier Failure to provide Proof of Delivery (POD)**  
In the event Carrier fails to provide a POD within 48 hours of delivery, Niagara shall have the right to deduct all amounts paid for Transportation Services or demand payment for the amount of the Transportation Service invoice. Additionally, if Carrier cannot provide the POD within fourteen (14) days of delivery, Niagara may charge Carrier for the cost of any of Niagara’s customer’s invoice for product not paid. Alternatively, if Niagara receives a refusal to pay for a Load from its customer, Niagara will provide Carrier with evidence of customer refusal and proof of loss and shall charge Carrier the cost of the customer’s invoice for the product.

**Assignment and Subcontracting**  
Carrier agrees not to interline, use other motor carriers or brokers, or to use “substituted services” or otherwise assign or subcontract any portion of any Award, agreement, or purchase order without the express written consent of Niagara. If, with the express written permission of Niagara, Carrier elects to use a delivery agent or subcontract the transportation of a Load, Carrier shall be the sole bearer of any costs associated with the delivery agent or subcontractor and agrees to be fully liable for any loss, damage, or delay to transportation of any such Loads while in this third-party carrier’s care, custody, and/or control. Carrier understands and agrees that all payments made by Niagara are conditioned upon Niagara’s receipt of a conditional waiver and release executed by Carrier and an unconditional waiver and release executed by each Additional Party. Carrier agrees to defend, indemnify, and hold Niagara and its customers harmless from any and all claims of any Additional Party for payment. Carrier acknowledges and agrees that Carrier shall remain, at all times, fully liable for all Additional Parties. Carrier warrants that it shall ensure that Additional Parties comply with and adhere to all warranties, representations, obligations, terms, and conditions contained herein.

**Compliance with Law**  
At all times during the Award or agreement term or its relationship with Niagara, Carrier shall comply with all applicable state and federal laws. Additionally, Carrier shall operate all Carrier Equipment in compliance with industry standards and shall maintain and operate the same such that Carrier’s safety rating does not fall below “satisfactory” under the Federal Motor Carrier Safety Administration standards. In the event that Carrier’s safety rating falls below “satisfactory,” Carrier shall notify Niagara immediately, and Niagara will have the immediate right to terminate any Award, agreement, or purchase order upon notice to Carrier.

**Indemnification**  
a) Carrier agrees to indemnify, defend, and hold Niagara, its affiliates, and representatives harmless from and against any and all claims arising out of or related to any Award, agreement, or purchase order and/or Transportation Services that are the subject thereof, including but not limited to: (i) any bodily injury or property damage claims, and any liability, loss, cost, expense, or other damages (including reasonable attorney fees) brought about by any injury of any kind suffered by any person or property as a result of any act, neglect, default, omission of either the Carrier, Carrier’s agents, employees, affiliates, subcontractors, or any third party for whose actions Carrier is responsible (“Carrier Actors”), or Niagara, Niagara’s agents, employees, affiliates, subcontractors, or other representatives; (ii) any negligent act, misfeasance, or nonfeasance by Carrier, or Carrier Actors; (iii) any harm, injury, damage, or loss arising out of or in connection with the Transportation Services provided; (iv) third-party consumer claims, suits, and/or demands, including costs and expenses of investigation and settlement and attorneys’ fees and expenses, to the extent such claims arise from: (a) any act or omission by Carrier or Carrier Actors relating to or affecting the condition, quality, or character of any Goods or Services provided; or (b) trademark, copyright, trade dress, or patent infringement. Carrier acknowledges and agrees that Carrier must receive Niagara’s express written approval prior to settling any claim or lawsuit. Niagara reserves the right at any time to control its own defense.  
b) Should Carrier receive (or become aware of) any demand, service of process, notice, action, settlement, summons, complaint, or the like from or by a third party alleging that a Party hereto is responsible for some injury, act, omission, breach, negligence, claim, loss, violation of law, settlement, cost, expense, obligation, liability, damage, recovery, deficiency, or otherwise, including, without limitation, interest, penalties, reasonable attorney fees, and costs (each, a “Claim”) that arises out of, results from, or in any way relates to the subject matter of these Standard Terms and Conditions, an Award, agreement, or purchase order, then Carrier shall immediately (but no later than five (5) business days after receipt, or becoming aware, of a third-party Claim) provide Niagara with written notice regarding each third-party Claim of which Carrier is or becomes aware. Carrier covenants and agrees that should Carrier fail to provide Niagara with timely written notice regarding any third-party Claim, Carrier hereby generally and expressly waives, relinquishes, and releases, and agrees to hold harmless, Niagara from and against any and all Claims capable of being asserted by Carrier against Niagara in connection therewith.  
c) In the event Carrier utilizes any party (“Additional Party”) regardless of that party’s legal designation of contractor, subcontractor, materials supplier, agent, or otherwise, for the purpose of performing any Transportation Services, Carrier shall submit to Niagara written notice of (i) each Additional Party, (ii) the duties each Additional Party will undertake, (iii) the amount of compensation each Additional Party is to receive from Carrier, and (iv) Carrier’s compensation schedule and payment terms with the Additional Party. Carrier understands submitting this written notice as set forth above is a condition precedent to payment. Such written notice must be sent to the Vice President of Legal Affairs via email and certified mail (1) panderson@niagarawater.com, (2) 2560 E. Philadelphia St., Ontario, CA 91761.  
g) **Waiver**: Niagara’s delay, failure, or partial exercise of any provision herein or waiver of any breach, right, or remedy contained in or granted by any Award, agreement, or purchase order shall not be deemed a waiver of any breach, right, or remedy unless expressly stated as such by Niagara in writing signed by an authorized representative of Niagara, and then such waiver shall be limited solely to its specific terms.

**Limitation of Liability**  
In no event shall Niagara be liable for any punitive, exemplary, special, incidental, indirect, or consequential damages of any kind (including, but not limited to loss of profits, loss of reputation, and/or loss of current or prospective business advantage, when where such losses are characterized as direct damages) arising out of or in any way related to the relationship and/or dealings between Niagara and Carrier regardless of whether the claim under which damages are sought is based upon contract, tort, negligence, strict liability, or otherwise, and regardless of whether the parties have been advised of the possibility of such damages at the time of contracting or otherwise. Under no circumstances shall Niagara’s maximum total liability, if any, arising out of or in any way related to the relationship and/or dealings between Niagara and Carrier exceed the amounts paid and/or due to Carrier by Niagara under any relationship between the Parties, Award, agreement, or purchase order.

**Liability for Loss, Damage, or Delay to Loads**  
a) Carrier agrees that in the transportation of all Loads hereunder, it shall assume, and does assume, the liability of an interstate motor carrier, as provided by 49 U.S.C. § 14706, with such liability to exist from the time of the receipt of any of said goods by Carrier until proper delivery has been made to the location specified by Niagara. The Parties expressly decline to limit the value of the property as permitted by 49 U.S.C. § 14706(c). All claims will be filed and resolved in accordance with the ICC regulations in 49 CFR Part 370.  
b) All Loads tendered to Carrier for transportation will be palletized and stretch-wrapped. Carrier reserves the right to refuse to accept any Load that is not so packaged.  
c) Parties agree that each incident of transportation of product under any Award, agreement, or purchase order shall be evidenced by a BOL signed by Carrier and Niagara showing the kind, quantity, value, and condition of products or goods received and delivered by Carrier at the loading and unloading points respectively. Carrier’s duties and responsibilities under any Award, agreement, or purchase order between the Parties for the transport of any Load evidenced by such receipt shall commence when Carrier takes possession and control of Niagara’s property or upon execution of such receipt by Niagara, whichever occurs first, and shall end when consignee/customer/buyer signs a delivery receipt and Carrier delivers Niagara’s property. Carrier shall inspect all Loads prior to accepting possession and control and shall document any evidence of damage on the BOL. If Carrier does not indicate damage on the BOL at the time of possession and immediately communicates the existence of such damage to Niagara, Carrier agrees that damage documented upon delivery presumptively occurred while the Load was in Carrier’s custody and possession.  
d) The time limit within which Niagara must file a claim for damaged or lost products or goods against Carrier shall be nine (9) months from the date of delivery or within nine (9) months of the reasonably anticipated date of delivery in the event of a complete loss. All claims shall be paid, settled, or disallowed by Carrier within ninety (90) days of filing. Disallowance shall state a lawful reason for declining to accept responsibility for the claim and shall be stated by Carrier, not its insurer. In no event shall Niagara be required to work with Carrier’s insurer directly. Niagara agrees to immediately provide written notice of claim to Carrier showing kind, quantity, value, and proof of carriage as evidenced by a signed BOL.  
e) In the event of Carrier’s breach, or alleged breach, as determined solely by Niagara, of any provision in any Award, agreement, or purchase order between the Parties, in addition to all other remedies in law or equity that are available to Niagara, Carrier shall be responsible for all reasonable attorneys’ fees and costs incurred by Niagara as a result of said breach or alleged breach.

**Product Loss or Damage**  
a) **Rejected Load**: In the event the Niagara’s customer rejects the delivery of any Load due to the fault of Carrier, Carrier must return the Load to the pick-up origin designated by Niagara at no cost. In the event Niagara’s customer rejects the delivery of a Load due to no fault of the Carrier, Niagara shall pay a transportation rate equal to the rate Niagara paid Carrier to transport the Load to Niagara’s customer. Any and all rejected Loads not scheduled for redelivery must be delivered back to Niagara’s pick-up origin within five (5) days from the time/date of initial pick-up. Any Load being transported back to Niagara’s pick-up origin must be secured with either a seal or padlock and a confirmation must be sent via email to executionteam@niagarawater.com. Return charges for short-haul clusters will be returned at half the published rate of the Load. For long-haul cluster freight, return charges will not exceed the total all-in rate of the Load.  
b) **Visual Damage to Products**: For damages to individual cases of product up to less than one pallet, Niagara’s customer must note the damage on the BOL, and customer or Carrier may dispose of or donate damaged cases of product. For damage to one or more pallets, Niagara’s customer must note the damage on the BOL. If the Load is rejected and remains in the custody of Carrier, Carrier must immediately contact Niagara Dispatch for deposition instructions. Carrier must provide the purchase order number, date and time of single delivery, number of pallets damaged and/or refused, bottle code, any photographs, a brief description of the damage, and contact information, including contact name, phone number, email, and facsimile number.  
c) **Concealed Damage to Products**: If Niagara’s customer reports concealed damage to the product, pallet, and/or Load, such damage will be investigated to determine liability. If the investigation concludes that Carrier is responsible for the damage, Carrier will be notified of Niagara’s intent to file a claim and will be given the opportunity to inspect the product, pallet, or Load prior to disposition for disposal or donation.  
d) **Product Loss/Delay**: In the event Carrier is unable to execute delivery for reasons such as theft of Load, vehicular accident, or delay impacting the product’s integrity (i.e., non-delivery of Load/products to its specified destination within five (5) calendar days), recovery of loss will be executed pursuant to 49 CFR 370.  
e) **Donation/Disposal**: Due to product liability, trademark protection, and/or licensing agreements for private label stock, any distressed, damaged, or otherwise rejected shipment that is not returned to a Niagara facility, for whatever reason, must be properly disposed of or donated in accordance with Niagara’s express written instruction. IN NO CIRCUMSTANCE CAN ANY GOODS, PRODUCTS, OR INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY EVER BE RE-SOLD. Carrier understands and agrees that in no event shall Carrier nor any Carrier Actors, without the prior express written consent of Niagara: (i) cause, suffer, or permit the transfer, salvage, disposal, and/or donation of any Goods, Products, or Intellectual Property, and/or (ii) offer to transfer, salvage, dispose of, and/or donate any Goods, Products, or Intellectual Property, whether as salvage or otherwise. Notwithstanding the foregoing, if there is a distressed, damaged, or otherwise rejected Load of product that is not returned to a Niagara facility, and Niagara gives express written permission to a Carrier to dispose of or donate the goods or products, Niagara shall require written verification, signed by the Carrier’s authorized agent, which provides exact details as to the final disposition as well as copies of donation/disposal receipts as backup.  
f) **Claim Settlement**: In order to close a freight claim as settled, one of the following conclusions must be obtained:  
- Granted: paid in full  
- Declined: written declination including a specific legal reason  
- Compromised: written offer to settle for less than the original claim amount, including legal rationale for the offer to pay less than the full amount claimed  
g) **Payment**: Any and all payments from Carrier to Niagara in settlement of a claim must be made, in full, and sent to: Niagara Bottling, LLC, 2560 E. Philadelphia Street, Ontario, CA 91761, Attention: Claims Specialist. Niagara’s claim reference number must appear on the check. A partial payment check will not be accepted and will not be cashed as a granted or settled claim.

**Seals**  
Carrier agrees to comply with the Food and Drug Administration and industry standards with regard to seals as codified in FDA 21 CFR 110.93, which states that all transportation of food shall be under conditions to protect that food. Storage and transportation of finished food shall be under conditions that will protect the food against physical, chemical, and microbial contamination as well as against deterioration of the food and the container. Carrier further agrees to use standard industry practices, including, but not limited to ensuring that any and all trailers from or on behalf of Niagara will be kept sealed while transporting all goods. Carrier must confirm that the seal has been secured on the trailer and that the seal number is recorded on the BOL by Niagara prior to leaving any of Niagara’s facilities. If the seal is required to be broken at any time during transport, Carrier must first seek Niagara’s authorization. Carrier must then notify Niagara that the trailer has been re-sealed by sending an email to executionteam@niagarawater.com. In the event Niagara’s customer breaks the seal, rejects the Load, and does not provide Carrier with a new seal to re-seal the trailer, Niagara’s customer or Carrier must add a lock to the trailer to secure the Load. It is Carrier’s sole responsibility to ensure that the trailer is re-sealed or a lock is added to the trailer prior to leaving Niagara’s customer’s facilities. No Loads will be accepted by Niagara without a seal or lock on the trailer.

**Insurance**  
During the term of all Awards, agreements, or purchase orders, and after any termination of or expiration, and for as long as Carrier owes any obligation to Niagara and/or any statute of limitations for any potential claim that Niagara may have against Carrier remains unexpired, Carrier and any Carrier Actors shall maintain all insurance and/or bonds required by statute, law, and any Award, agreement, or purchase order with minimum insurance limits consistent with Niagara’s insurance requirements set forth at the end of this Section 16. Should insurance policy limits be exhausted or should Carrier or any Carrier Actors fail to maintain the required insurance coverage, neither Carrier nor any Carrier Actor will in any way be relieved from liability provided for herein to Niagara should a loss occur. Carrier shall furnish Niagara with a certificate evidencing the aforementioned coverage limits via email to insurancecerts@niagarawater.com. Such certificate shall provide for thirty (30) days written notice to Niagara in the event of cancellation. All certificates of insurance shall name Niagara Bottling, LLC and its parents, subsidiaries, employees, agents, affiliates, and assigns as an additional insured by policy endorsement (on both Carrier’s General Liability Policy, Automobile Liability Policy, and Cargo Insurance Policy) and waive all rights of subrogation against Niagara, its parent, director, officers, employees, stockholders, subsidiaries, and affiliates with regard to Employee Liability and Workers Compensation. For any claims relating to an Agreement, agreement, or purchase order, the Carrier’s insurance shall be deemed to be primary and not contributing to or in excess of any similar coverage purchased by Niagara. Carrier hereby acknowledges that naming Niagara Bottling, LLC and its parents, subsidiaries, employees, agents, affiliates, and assigns as an additional insured by policy endorsement is a condition precedent to payment by Niagara. For the avoidance of doubt, Niagara will not be required to submit payment until the requirements of this provision have been met. However, failure of Niagara to demand any certificates or to identify any deficiency in the insurance provided shall not be construed as or deemed to be a waiver of the Carrier’s (or its agents or subcontractors) obligation to maintain such insurance. If any of the coverages are required to remain in force after termination of the Agreement, Carrier shall submit additional certificates evidencing continuation of coverage until such obligation ends.  

**Niagara’s Minimum Insurance Requirements**:  
- Commercial General Liability: $2,000,000 per occurrence; $5,000,000 aggregate  
- Auto Liability: $3,000,000 combined single limit  
- Cargo: $100,000  
- Employee Liability/Workman’s Comp: $2,000,000/Statutory  

In addition to the general insurance requirements provided in the above table, customized insurance requirements for specific Seller-types are attached hereto and incorporated herein by this reference.

**Termination**  
a) Any Award, agreement, or purchase order shall commence on the date such Award is given, agreement is entered into, or purchase order is issued, and shall automatically renew on a year-to-year basis until terminated, provided that Carrier is performing in accordance with these Carrier Standard T&C’s, the Award, agreement, or purchase order, and that Carrier continues to provide Niagara the lowest available rates in the market and the lowest rates and/or most favorable terms at which Carrier offers its service to any third-party shipper in the same functional level of the trade as Niagara (“Most Favorable Rates”). The Parties agree to meet in good faith to discuss existing rates at a time no earlier than twelve (12) months after the Award is issued or an agreement is entered into by the Parties. Such discussions may result in a rate adjustment if, and only if, the adjustment is in reference to driver pay, and only upon mutual written consent by both Parties. Notwithstanding the foregoing, Carrier guarantees that any rate increase will not exceed 2% of the current rate. In the event that Carrier does not provide Niagara with the Most Favorable Rates, Niagara shall have the right to terminate by giving thirty (30) days written notice to Carrier.  
b) If during the term specified by any Award, agreement, or purchase order either party (i) files a petition in bankruptcy or has a petition in bankruptcy filed against it that is not dismissed within sixty (60) days, or (ii) makes a general assignment for the benefit of creditors, then in any such case the non-bankrupt party may terminate any Award, agreement, or purchase order by giving written notice of such effect to the bankrupt party.  
c) If all or any portion of Carrier’s registration, as required by any Award, agreement, or purchase order, is revoked, canceled, suspended, or discontinued by operation of law or otherwise (“Registration Issue”), or if Carrier’s insurance policies are canceled, reduced, or otherwise invalidated (“Insurance Issue”), Carrier shall promptly notify Niagara, and in no case later than forty-eight (48) hours after Carrier learns of any such Registration or Insurance Issue and Niagara shall have the right to terminate any Award, agreement, or purchase order immediately and/or collect reimbursement for all expenses it has incurred in preparation of and/or as a result of any Award, agreement, or purchase order from Carrier. Carrier’s notification to Niagara in regards to the above shall in no way serve as a waiver by Niagara of its right to construe such as a breach of any Award, agreement, or purchase order and shall in no way limit Niagara’s right to pursue all remedies in law or equity as a result of such breach.  
d) If, in Niagara’s sole discretion, delays in transportation cause inconvenience and/or harm to Niagara’s business interests, or Carrier is otherwise in breach of any Award, agreement, or purchase order, Niagara shall provide written notice to Carrier outlining the delay and resulting or anticipated harm and/or breach. If the deficiencies and/or breach remain following a period of thirty (30) days from the date written notice was provided, as is measured as of the date specified on the notice, Niagara may terminate any Award, agreement, or purchase order upon thirty (30) days written notice to Carrier.  
e) In the event of any discontinuation and/or revision to any regulations and/or laws in the United States (or any other country where Carrier services Niagara), and/or if Niagara, in its sole discretion, determines that the services contemplated in any Award, agreement, or purchase order are no longer necessary or required and/or that Niagara’s course of business strategy has changed, Niagara may terminate any Award, agreement, or purchase order in part or in its entirety upon sixty (60) days’ notice to Carrier.  
f) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary herein, Niagara shall have the ability to terminate any Award, agreement, or purchase order for convenience with a sixty (60) day written notice, and Carrier shall have the ability to terminate any Award or agreement with one hundred eighty (180) day written notice to Niagara.

**General Provisions**  
a) **Confidentiality**: Throughout the term of any Award, agreement, or purchase order between the Parties, the Parties may come into possession of information or data which constitute trade secrets, know-how, confidential information, or are otherwise considered to be secret (hereinafter “Confidential Information”).

b) **Severability**: If any phrase, clause, sentence, or other provision contained in these Standard Carrier T&C’s, or any Award, agreement, or purchase order shall violate any applicable statute, ordinance, rule, or law, are deemed inoperative or unenforceable then the same shall be deemed severed here, to the extent of such violation; provided, however, that the remainder of these Standard Carrier T&C’s, or any Award, agreement, or purchase order shall remain in effect.  
c) **Notices**: Except as specifically provided herein, any notices required hereunder shall become effective when delivered personally or sent by registered mail, certified mail, or overnight courier service to the Parties at their respective addresses.

Philadelphia Street, Ontario, California 91761, Attn: Vice President of Legal Affairs and via email to panderson@niagarawater.com.  
d) **Anti-Kickback**: Carrier will not make any payment or transfer anything of value, directly or indirectly, to any employee of Niagara. It is the intent of the parties that no payments or transfers of anything of value shall be made which may have the purpose or effect (real or perceived) of bribery, acceptance of or acquiescence in kickbacks or other improper means of obtaining business.  
e) **Inspection**: Upon request by Niagara, any duly authorized representative of Niagara shall, until two (2) years after final payment under an Award, agreement, or purchase order between the Parties, have access to and right to examine directly pertinent books, papers, documents, accounts, and records of Carrier involving transactions between the Parties.  
f) **Independent Contractor**: Carrier shall act as an independent contractor and not as an agent or employee of Niagara.  
g) **Mitigation of Damages**: In the event that Carrier is unable to perform any obligation, in whole or in part, under any Award, agreement, or purchase order between the Parties, Niagara shall be entitled to purchase the requisite Transportation Services from another available source and Carrier will be liable for any additional costs incurred by Niagara.  
h) **Force Majeure**: In the event of storms, acts of God, riots, civil insurrection, flood, strike, war, or any other force majeure event that reduces or otherwise limits Carrier’s Transportation Service or delivery capabilities, Carrier shall use best efforts to meet its commitments to Niagara in accordance with any Award, agreement, or purchase order.  
i) These Standard Carrier T&C’s and/or any Award, agreement, or purchase order shall exclusively govern any relationship between Niagara and Carrier. To the extent that there is any conflict between these Standard Carrier T&C’s and/or any Award, agreement, or purchase order, these Standard Carrier T&C’s shall control. Any additional or contrary terms set forth in any of the Parties’ purchase orders, bills of lading, invoices, or other documentation shall have no force or effect.

l) **Attorneys’ Fees**: In the event a dispute cannot be resolved with respect to these Standard Carrier T&C’s and/or any Award, agreement, or purchase order between the Parties or the Transportation Services contemplated herein, the prevailing Party in such dispute shall be entitled to recover all actual and reasonable expenses including, without limitation, reasonable attorneys’ fees and expenses incurred in ascertaining such Party’s rights in preparing to enforce, or enforcing such Party’s rights under these Standard Carrier T&C’s and/or any Award, agreement, or purchase, whether or not it was necessary for such party to institute a suit in a court of law.

**Accessorial Terms**  
The following shall apply to all Awards and agreements between the Parties for Transportation Services:  
a) **On-Time Requirement**: In the event that Carrier’s driver arrives between the window of thirty (30) minutes before or thirty (30) minutes after any pick-up appointment, Niagara shall check-in and Load Carrier’s trailer. If Carrier’s driver arrives between the window of thirty-one (31) minutes to two (2) hours after any pick-up appointment, no accessorial charges or fees will be owed by Niagara, and Niagara will make commercially reasonable efforts to check-in and Load Carrier’s trailer. In the event that Carrier’s driver arrives to any pick-up appointment over two (2) hours late, no accessorial charges or fees will be paid by Niagara to Carrier, and Niagara may, at its sole discretion, reject and not Load the trailer, and assess no-show charges against Carrier.  
b) **Free Wait Time**: Two (2) hours of free waiting time will be honored by the Carrier at both origin and destination.

Upon notification to Niagara, Niagara shall have twenty-four (24) hours to resolve the issue and Carrier agrees not to charge Niagara with any fees or penalties. In the event Carrier’s trailer is not released after this time period, Niagara agrees to pay Carrier a drop trailer detention rate not to exceed $40 per day. Carrier shall monitor the status of any detained trailer and provide Niagara with daily notifications as to the status of such detained trailer via email to executionteam@niagarawater.com. Release of a trailer shall immediately end all drop trailer detention rate charges to Niagara. Carrier shall invoice Niagara separately for any drop trailer detention rates. Carrier will agree to communicate any potential issue leading to an accessorial charge at the time an incident occurs in order to allow Niagara an opportunity to resolve the issue. All accessorial charges requested 24 hours after an incident has occurred will not be approved.

e) **Stop-off Charges**: Not to exceed $50.00 per additional stop.  
f) **Layover Charges**: Not to exceed $250.00 per day.  
g) In no event shall Carrier be able to charge Niagara both a detention charge and a layover charge, nor shall Carrier charge Niagara both detention and TONU charges.  
h) **Truck Order Not Used (“TONU”)**: TONU charge shall not exceed $250. In no event will TONU charge exceed the cost of the products being transported.

i) **No Show Charge**: If Carrier fails to pick up a tender that Carrier previously accepted and fails to notify Niagara at least 12 hours prior to the scheduled pick-up time, then Niagara may charge Carrier a no-show charge in the amount of $150 dollars or deduct the same from Carrier’s account with reference to the purchase order number for the tender of the Load.  
j) **Lumper**: If Carrier is prohibited from unloading a trailer and Customer requires the hiring of a Lumper, Niagara agrees to reimburse Carrier for any Lumper, provided Carrier provides the Lumper receipt for the exact amount charged by the lumper service, with no markup, to each invoice referencing the corresponding purchase order number.  
k) **Driver Assist**: If Niagara’s customer is requiring Carrier to unload via driver assist, the charge will not exceed $50 per Load.  
l) **Re-Delivery**: In the event Niagara’s customer rejects or refuses delivery of a Load due to the fault of the Carrier, such as arriving late for the delivery appointment, Carrier must redeliver the Load at no further cost or expense to Niagara. In the event Niagara’s customer rejects or refuses delivery of a Load due to no fault of Carrier, Carrier agrees to redeliver the Load at a cost equal to or less than the cost of initial delivery. Carrier agrees to make every attempt to hold the Load in close proximity to Niagara’s customer’s delivery location.  
m) **Diversion Charges**: In the event that Carrier attempts to deliver to a location as specified by Niagara, and the Load is rejected, Niagara reserves the right to divert Carrier’s driver to another customer location within 150 miles of the original delivery location. Niagara shall pay diversion costs in accordance with the following chart:

| Distance from Original Location in miles | Diversion Rate to be Paid to Carrier (in US Dollars) |

| 26-50                                   | $100                                                |
| 51-100                                  | $200                                                |
| 101-150                                 | $250                                                |

In no event shall Carrier have a lien on any of Niagara’s Loads, products, or finished goods to secure payment of any invoices or charges. Carrier agrees to comply with all technological requirements of Niagara and its customers, including but not limited to 100% transactional compliance and specifically 204-Load Tender, 210-Carrier Invoice, 214-Shipment Status, and 990-Load Tender Response. Carrier shall be solely responsible for any and all costs for and associated with such technology.

**Award Acceptance**  
Once Carrier signs and accepts any Award, Carrier agrees to transport a minimum of 99% of any tender offers for such Lane(s). If Carrier falls below this 99% threshold, Carrier agrees to be liable for all damages arising due to Carrier’s failure, plus a fee equal to 4% of Carrier’s Base Rate. Such damages include, but are not limited to, costs incurred by Niagara in excess of the Base Rate to secure delivery of any Loads described in such tender offer by a third-party carrier. Should Niagara subsequently offer tenders for Loads not included in the Award or agreement and Carrier agrees to transport such Loads, Carrier agrees to transport such Load at the same rates as the delivery of Loads in the Award unless otherwise agreed to in writing by the Parties. Carrier must notify Niagara within ninety (90) minutes of receipt of Niagara’s tender offer that Carrier has: (a) received the tender offer; and (b) confirm that it will transport the Load.

**Carrier Performance**  
Carrier understands that all Transportation Services must be performed in a timely fashion. Carrier is solely responsible for scheduling and complying with any and all deliveries and delivery times as requested by Niagara’s customers.  
a) **Pick-up of Loads**: Carrier shall maintain a monthly on-time pick-up appointment rate of a minimum of 90% from the designated Niagara facility through the entire term of the Award. If Carrier’s monthly pick-up rate falls below 90%, Carrier agrees to a $50 fee for every late pick-up appointment for the previous month that caused Carrier to fall below the 90% pick-up rate.  
b) **Delivery of Loads**: Carrier shall maintain a 98% monthly rate for on-time delivery of Loads through the entire term of the Award. On-time delivery of Loads shall mean Loads delivered within thirty (30) minutes of a scheduled delivery appointment time. If Carrier’s monthly on-time delivery rate to Niagara or its customer’s locations falls below 98%, Carrier agrees to a $100 fee for every late and/or missed delivery appointment for the previous month that caused Carrier to fall below the 98% delivery rate.  
c) **Payload**: Carrier warrants that it has the ability to ship Loads that are 45,600 pounds or less. Niagara may scale and weigh all Loads and shall provide a pallet count for all Loads. In accepting any Load, Carrier agrees to count all pallet quantities prior to sealing the trailer. Niagara will make its best effort to produce a tactical forecast of the projected volume of Loads and weights for the upcoming month. In the event Niagara requests Carrier to haul 20% more of its projected daily volume, Carrier shall comply with such a request. In the event Carrier is unable to haul Niagara’s scale and weighted Load, causing Niagara to remove any products or pallets, Carrier agrees that Niagara may deduct a fee of $100 per occurrence from Carrier’s corresponding purchase order.  
d) **Equipment**: Carrier shall ensure that all equipment used in connection with performing Transportation Services be clean, odor-free, dry, leak-proof, and free of contamination and/or infestation. Carrier warrants that no motor vehicle, trailer, tractor, or other equipment that will be used for Transportation Services for Niagara has been used to transport refuse, garbage, trash, or solid or liquid waste of any kind, or any types of hazardous materials. Carrier agrees that any breach of this provision may result in substantial harm to Niagara’s products and/or customers and may have a detrimental effect on Niagara’s reputation and image in the marketplace, product integrity, and goodwill. Niagara may, at its sole discretion, reject any and all trailers for issues including, but not limited to, odors, debris from prior shipment, or lack of structural integrity. Carriers shall not be permitted more than a 1% trailer rejection rate per month.  
e) **Operation**: Carrier shall ensure and bear all costs and expenses related to the operation of its motor vehicles, trailers, tractors, and equipment (“Carrier Equipment”), including ensuring that only fully qualified and licensed personnel operate any Carrier Equipment in accordance with, or as required by all applicable local, state, and/or federal laws, regulations, and authorities.  
f) **Customer Service**: Carrier, at its sole expense, must maintain and make available a telephone line for customer service to Niagara. Such customer service line will be operational twenty-four hours a day, seven days a week, and shall respond within thirty (30) minutes of contact by Niagara.

**Documentation**  
With respect to the following documents, Carrier agrees to maintain the documents as follows:  
a) **Daily reports**: Carrier shall provide Niagara daily reports regarding the status of all Loads and delivery times;  
b) **Proof of Delivery (POD)**: Carrier shall provide Niagara free of charge with any and all PODs within 48 hours of delivery of any Load and shall maintain all such PODs for at least twelve (12) months from the date of delivery, or for a period as proscribed by law;  
c) **Bill of Lading (BOL)**: Carrier agrees that Niagara’s bill of lading shall be considered: (i) an acceptable form of receipt hereunder, and (ii) specific shipping instructions. These Standard Carrier T&C’s shall be incorporated by reference into each and every such BOL and in the event of an inconsistency, these Standard Carrier T&C’s shall control;  
d) **Supporting documents for Accessorial charges**: Carrier agrees to provide all documents in accordance with Section 18 of these Standard Terms and Conditions.

**Carrier Failure to provide Proof of Delivery (POD)**  
In the event Carrier fails to provide a POD within 48 hours of delivery, Niagara shall have the right to deduct all amounts paid for Transportation Services or demand payment for the amount of the Transportation Service invoice. Additionally, if Carrier cannot provide the POD within fourteen (14) days of delivery, Niagara may charge Carrier for the cost of any of Niagara’s customer’s invoice for product not paid. Alternatively, if Niagara receives a refusal to pay for a Load from its customer, Niagara will provide Carrier with evidence of customer refusal and proof of loss and shall charge Carrier the cost of the customer’s invoice for product.

**Assignment and Subcontracting**  
Carrier agrees not to interline, use other motor carriers or brokers, or to use “substituted services” or otherwise assign or subcontract any portion of any Award, agreement, or purchase order without the express written consent of Niagara. If, with the express written permission of Niagara, Carrier elects to use a delivery agent or subcontract the transportation of a Load, Carrier shall be the sole bearer of any costs associated with the delivery agent or subcontractor and agrees to be fully liable for any loss, damage, or delay to transportation of any such Loads while in this third-party carrier’s care, custody, and/or control. Carrier understands and agrees that all payments made by Niagara are conditioned upon Niagara’s receipt of a conditional waiver and release executed by Carrier and an unconditional waiver and release executed by each Additional Party. Carrier agrees to defend, indemnify, and hold Niagara and its customers harmless from any and all claims of any Additional Party for payment. Carrier acknowledges and agrees that Carrier shall remain, at all times, fully liable for all Additional Parties. Carrier warrants that it shall ensure that Additional Parties comply with and adhere to all warranties, representations, obligations, terms, and conditions contained herein.

**Compliance with Law**  
At all times during the Award or agreement term or its relationship with Niagara, Carrier shall comply with all applicable state and federal laws. Additionally, Carrier shall operate all Carrier Equipment in compliance with industry standards and shall maintain and operate the same such that Carrier’s safety rating does not fall below “satisfactory” under the Federal Motor Carrier Safety Administration standards. In the event that Carrier’s safety rating falls below “satisfactory,” Carrier shall notify Niagara immediately, and Niagara will have the immediate right to terminate any Award, agreement, or purchase order upon notice to Carrier.

**Indemnification**  
a) Carrier agrees to indemnify, defend, and hold Niagara, its affiliates, and representatives harmless from and against any and all claims arising out of or related to any Award, agreement, or purchase order and/or Transportation Services that are the subject thereof, including but not limited to: (i) any bodily injury or property damage claims, and any liability, loss, cost, expense, or other damages (including reasonable attorney fees) brought about by any injury of any kind suffered by any person or property as a result of any act, neglect, default, omission of either the Carrier, Carrier’s agents, employees, affiliates, subcontractors, or any third party for whose actions Carrier is responsible (“Carrier Actors”), or Niagara, Niagara’s agents, employees, affiliates, subcontractors, or other representatives; (ii) any negligent act, misfeasance, or nonfeasance by Carrier, or Carrier Actors; (iii) any harm, injury, damage, or loss arising out of or in connection with the Transportation Services provided; (iv) third-party consumer claims, suits, and/or demands, including costs and expenses of investigation and settlement and attorneys’ fees and expenses, to the extent such claims arise from: (a) any act or omission by Carrier or Carrier Actors relating to or affecting the condition, quality, or character of any Goods or Services provided; or (b) trademark, copyright, trade dress, or patent infringement. Carrier acknowledges and agrees that Carrier must receive Niagara’s express written approval prior to settling any claim or lawsuit. Niagara reserves the right at any time to control its own defense.  
b) Should Carrier receive (or become aware of) any demand, service of process, notice, action, settlement, summons, complaint, or the like from or by a third party alleging that a Party hereto is responsible for some injury, act, omission, breach, negligence, claim, loss, violation of law, settlement, cost, expense, obligation, liability, damage, recovery, deficiency, or otherwise, including, without limitation, interest, penalties, reasonable attorney fees, and costs (each, a “Claim”) that arises out of, results from, or in any way relates to the subject matter of these Standard Terms and Conditions, an Award, agreement, or purchase order, then Carrier shall immediately (but no later than five (5) business days after receipt, or becoming aware, of a third-party Claim) provide Niagara with written notice regarding each third-party Claim of which Carrier is or becomes aware. Carrier covenants and agrees that should Carrier fail to provide Niagara with timely written notice regarding any third-party Claim, Carrier hereby generally and expressly waives, relinquishes, and releases, and agrees to hold harmless, Niagara from and against any and all Claims capable of being asserted by Carrier against Niagara in connection therewith.  
c) In the event Carrier utilizes any party (“Additional Party”) regardless of that party’s legal designation of contractor, subcontractor, materials supplier, agent, or otherwise, for the purpose of performing any Transportation Services, Carrier shall submit to Niagara written notice of (i) each Additional Party, (ii) the duties each Additional Party will undertake, (iii) the amount of compensation each Additional Party is to receive from Carrier, and (iv) Carrier’s compensation schedule and payment terms with the Additional Party. Carrier understands submitting this written notice as set forth above is a condition precedent to payment. Such written notice must be sent to the Vice President of Legal Affairs via email and certified mail (1) panderson@niagarawater.com, (2) 2560 E. Philadelphia St., Ontario, CA 91761.  
g) **Waiver**: Niagara’s delay, failure, or partial exercise of any provision herein or waiver of any breach, right, or remedy contained in or granted by any Award, agreement, or purchase order shall not be deemed a waiver of any breach, right, or remedy unless expressly stated as such by Niagara in writing signed by an authorized representative of Niagara, and then such waiver shall be limited solely to its specific terms.

**Limitation of Liability**  
In no event shall Niagara be liable for any punitive, exemplary, special, incidental, indirect, or consequential damages of any kind (including, but not limited to loss of profits, loss of reputation, and/or loss of current or prospective business advantage, when where such losses are characterized as direct damages) arising out of or in any way related to the relationship and/or dealings between Niagara and Carrier regardless of whether the claim under which damages are sought is based upon contract, tort, negligence, strict liability, or otherwise, and regardless of whether the parties have been advised of the possibility of such damages at the time of contracting or otherwise. Under no circumstances shall Niagara’s maximum total liability, if any, arising out of or in any way related to the relationship and/or dealings between Niagara and Carrier exceed the amounts paid and/or due to Carrier by Niagara under any relationship between the Parties, Award, agreement, or purchase order.

**Liability for Loss, Damage, or Delay to Loads**  
a) Carrier agrees that in the transportation of all Loads hereunder, it shall assume, and does assume, the liability of an interstate motor carrier, as provided by 49 U.S.C. § 14706, with such liability to exist from the time of the receipt of any of said goods by Carrier until proper delivery has been made to the location specified by Niagara. The Parties expressly decline to limit the value of the property as permitted by 49 U.S.C. § 14706(c). All claims will be filed and resolved in accordance with the ICC regulations in 49 CFR Part 370.  
b) All Loads tendered to Carrier for transportation will be palletized and stretch-wrapped. Carrier reserves the right to refuse to accept any Load that is not so packaged.  
c) Parties agree that each incident of transportation of product under any Award, agreement, or purchase order shall be evidenced by a BOL signed by Carrier and Niagara showing the kind, quantity, value, and condition of products or goods received and delivered by Carrier at the loading and unloading points respectively. Carrier’s duties and responsibilities under any Award, agreement, or purchase order between the Parties for the transport of any Load evidenced by such receipt shall commence when Carrier takes possession and control of Niagara’s property or upon execution of such receipt by Niagara, whichever occurs first, and shall end when consignee/customer/buyer signs a delivery receipt and Carrier delivers Niagara’s property. Carrier shall inspect all Loads prior to accepting possession and control and shall document any evidence of damage on the BOL. If Carrier does not indicate damage on the BOL at the time of possession and immediately communicates the existence of such damage to Niagara, Carrier agrees that damage documented upon delivery presumptively occurred while the Load was in Carrier’s custody and possession.  
d) The time limit within which Niagara must file a claim for damaged or lost products or goods against Carrier shall be nine (9) months from the date of delivery or within nine (9) months of the reasonably anticipated date of delivery in the event of a complete loss. All claims shall be paid, settled, or disallowed by Carrier within ninety (90) days of filing. Disallowance shall state a lawful reason for declining to accept responsibility for the claim and shall be stated by Carrier, not its insurer. In no event shall Niagara be required to work with Carrier’s insurer directly. Niagara agrees to immediately provide written notice of claim to Carrier showing kind, quantity, value, and proof of carriage as evidenced by a signed BOL.  
e) In the event of Carrier’s breach, or alleged breach, as determined solely by Niagara, of any provision in any Award, agreement, or purchase order between the Parties, in addition to all other remedies in law or equity that are available to Niagara, Carrier shall be responsible for all reasonable attorneys’ fees and costs incurred by Niagara as a result of said breach or alleged breach.

**Product Loss or Damage**  
a) **Rejected Load**: In the event the Niagara’s customer rejects the delivery of any Load due to the fault of Carrier, Carrier must return the Load to the pick-up origin designated by Niagara at no cost. In the event Niagara’s customer rejects the delivery of a Load due to no fault of the Carrier, Niagara shall pay a transportation rate equal to the rate Niagara paid Carrier to transport the Load to Niagara’s customer. Any and all rejected Loads not scheduled for redelivery must be delivered back to Niagara’s pick-up origin within five (5) days from the time/date of initial pick-up. Any Load being transported back to Niagara’s pick-up origin must be secured with either a seal or padlock and a confirmation must be sent via email to executionteam@niagarawater.com. Return charges for short-haul clusters will be returned at half the published rate of the Load. For long-haul cluster freight, return charges will not exceed the total all-in rate of the Load.  
b) **Visual Damage to Products**: For damages to individual cases of product up to less than one pallet, Niagara’s customer must note the damage on the BOL, and customer or Carrier may dispose of or donate damaged cases of product. For damage to one or more pallets, Niagara’s customer must note the damage on the BOL. If the Load is rejected and remains in the custody of Carrier, Carrier must immediately contact Niagara Dispatch for deposition instructions. Carrier must provide the purchase order number, date and time of single delivery, number of pallets damaged and/or refused, bottle code, any photographs, a brief description of the damage, and contact information, including contact name, phone number, email, and facsimile number.  
c) **Concealed Damage to Products**: If Niagara’s customer reports concealed damage to the product, pallet, and/or Load, such damage will be investigated to determine liability. If the investigation concludes that Carrier is responsible for the damage, Carrier will be notified of Niagara’s intent to file a claim and will be given the opportunity to inspect the product, pallet, or Load prior to disposition for disposal or donation.  
d) **Product Loss/Delay**: In the event Carrier is unable to execute delivery for reasons such as theft of Load, vehicular accident, or delay impacting the product’s integrity (i.e., non-delivery of Load/products to its specified destination within five (5) calendar days), recovery of loss will be executed pursuant to 49 CFR 370.  
e) **Donation/Disposal**: Due to product liability, trademark protection, and/or licensing agreements for private label stock, any distressed, damaged, or otherwise rejected shipment that is not returned to a Niagara facility, for whatever reason, must be properly disposed of or donated in accordance with Niagara’s express written instruction. IN NO CIRCUMSTANCE CAN ANY GOODS, PRODUCTS, OR INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY EVER BE RE-SOLD. Carrier understands and agrees that in no event shall Carrier nor any Carrier Actors, without the prior express written consent of Niagara: (i) cause, suffer, or permit the transfer, salvage, disposal, and/or donation of any Goods, Products, or Intellectual Property, and/or (ii) offer to transfer, salvage, dispose of, and/or donate any Goods, Products, or Intellectual Property, whether as salvage or otherwise. Notwithstanding the foregoing, if there is a distressed, damaged, or otherwise rejected Load of product that is not returned to a Niagara facility, and Niagara gives express written permission to a Carrier to dispose of or donate the goods or products, Niagara shall require written verification, signed by the Carrier’s authorized agent, which provides exact details as to the final disposition as well as copies of donation/disposal receipts as backup.  
f) **Claim Settlement**: In order to close a freight claim as settled, one of the following conclusions must be obtained:  
- Granted: paid in full  
- Declined: written declination including a specific legal reason  
- Compromised: written offer to settle for less than the original claim amount, including legal rationale for the offer to pay less than the full amount claimed  

g) **Payment**: Any and all payments from Carrier to Niagara in settlement of a claim must be made, in full, and sent to:  
Niagara Bottling, LLC  
2560 E. Philadelphia Street  
Ontario, CA 91761  
Attention: Claims Specialist  
Niagara’s claim reference number must appear on the check. A partial payment check will not be accepted and will not be cashed as a granted or settled claim.

**Seals**  
Carrier agrees to comply with the Food and Drug Administration and industry standards with regard to seals as codified in FDA 21 CFR 110.93, which states that all transportation of food shall be under conditions to protect that food. Storage and transportation of finished food shall be under conditions that will protect the food against physical, chemical, and microbial contamination as well as against deterioration of the food and the container. Carrier further agrees to use standard industry practices, including, but not limited to ensuring that any and all trailers from or on behalf of Niagara will be kept sealed while transporting all goods. Carrier must confirm that the seal has been secured on the trailer and that the seal number is recorded on the BOL by Niagara prior to leaving any of Niagara’s facilities. If the seal is required to be broken at any time during transport, Carrier must first seek Niagara’s authorization. Carrier must then notify Niagara that the trailer has been re-sealed by sending an e-mail to executionteam@niagarawater.com. In the event Niagara’s customer breaks the seal, rejects the Load, and does not provide Carrier with a new seal to re-seal the trailer, Niagara’s customer or Carrier must add a lock to the trailer to secure the Load. It is Carrier’s sole responsibility to ensure that the trailer is re-sealed or a lock is added to the trailer prior to leaving Niagara’s customer’s facilities. No Loads will be accepted by Niagara without a seal or lock on the trailer.

**Insurance**  
During the term of all Awards, agreements, or purchase orders, and after any termination of or expiration, and for as long as Carrier owes any obligation to Niagara and/or any statute of limitations for any potential claim that Niagara may have against Carrier remains unexpired, Carrier and any Carrier Actors shall maintain all insurance and/or bonds required by statute, law, and any Award, agreement, or purchase order with minimum insurance limits consistent with Niagara’s insurance requirements set forth at the end of this Section 16. Should insurance policy limits be exhausted or should Carrier or any Carrier Actors fail to maintain the required insurance coverage, neither Carrier nor any Carrier Actor will in any way be relieved from liability provided for herein to Niagara should a loss occur. Carrier shall furnish Niagara with a certificate evidencing the aforementioned coverage limits via email to insurancecerts@niagarawater.com. Such certificate shall provide for thirty (30) days written notice to Niagara in the event of cancellation. All certificates of insurance shall name Niagara Bottling, LLC and its parents, subsidiaries, employees, agents, affiliates, and assigns as an additional insured by policy endorsement (on both Carrier’s General Liability Policy, Automobile Liability Policy, and Cargo Insurance Policy) and waive all rights of subrogation against Niagara, its parent, director, officers, employees, stockholders, subsidiaries, and affiliates with regard to Employee Liability and Workers Compensation. For any claims relating to an Agreement, agreement, or purchase order, the Carrier’s insurance shall be deemed to be primary and not contributing to or in excess of any similar coverage purchased by Niagara. Carrier hereby acknowledges that naming Niagara Bottling, LLC and its parents, subsidiaries, employees, agents, affiliates, and assigns as an additional insured by policy endorsement is a condition precedent to payment by Niagara. For the avoidance of doubt, Niagara will not be required to submit payment until the requirements of this provision have been met. However, failure of Niagara to demand any certificates or to identify any deficiency in the insurance provided shall not be construed as or deemed to be a waiver of the Carrier’s (or its agents or subcontractors) obligation to maintain such insurance. If any of the coverages are required to remain in force after termination of the Agreement, Carrier shall submit additional certificates evidencing continuation of coverage until such obligation ends.  

**Niagara’s Minimum Insurance Requirements**:  
- Commercial General Liability: $2,000,000 per occurrence; $5,000,000 aggregate  
- Auto Liability: $3,000,000 combined single limit  
- Cargo: $100,000  
- Employee Liability/Workman’s Comp: $2,000,000/Statutory  

In addition to the general insurance requirements provided in the above table, customized insurance requirements for specific Seller-types are attached hereto and incorporated herein by this reference.

**Termination**  
a) Any Award, agreement, or purchase order shall commence on the date such Award is given, agreement is entered into, or purchase order is issued, and shall automatically renew on a year-to-year basis until terminated, provided that Carrier is performing in accordance with these Carrier Standard T&C’s, the Award, agreement, or purchase order, and that Carrier continues to provide Niagara the lowest available rates in the market and the lowest rates and/or most favorable terms at which Carrier offers its service to any third-party shipper in the same functional level of the trade as Niagara (“Most Favorable Rates”). The Parties agree to meet in good faith to discuss existing rates at a time no earlier than twelve (12) months after the Award is issued or an agreement is entered into by the Parties. Such discussions may result in a rate adjustment if, and only if, the adjustment is in reference to driver pay, and only upon mutual written consent by both Parties. Notwithstanding the foregoing, Carrier guarantees that any rate increase will not exceed 2% of the current rate. In the event that Carrier does not provide Niagara with the Most Favorable Rates, Niagara shall have the right to terminate by giving thirty (30) days written notice to Carrier.  
b) If during the term specified by any Award, agreement, or purchase order either party (i) files a petition in bankruptcy or has a petition in bankruptcy filed against it that is not dismissed within sixty (60) days, or (ii) makes a general assignment for the benefit of creditors, then in any such case the non-bankrupt party may terminate any Award, agreement, or purchase order by giving written notice of such effect to the bankrupt party.  
c) If all or any portion of Carrier’s registration, as required by any Award, agreement, or purchase order, is revoked, canceled, suspended, or discontinued by operation of law or otherwise (“Registration Issue”), or if Carrier’s insurance policies are canceled, reduced, or otherwise invalidated (“Insurance Issue”), Carrier shall promptly notify Niagara, and in no case later than forty-eight (48) hours after Carrier learns of any such Registration or Insurance Issue and Niagara shall have the right to terminate any Award, agreement, or purchase order immediately and/or collect reimbursement for all expenses it has incurred in preparation of and/or as a result of any Award, agreement, or purchase order from Carrier. Carrier’s notification to Niagara in regards to the above shall in no way serve as a waiver by Niagara of its right to construe such as a breach of any Award, agreement, or purchase order and shall in no way limit Niagara’s right to pursue all remedies in law or equity as a result of such breach.  
d) If, in Niagara’s sole discretion, delays in transportation cause inconvenience and/or harm to Niagara’s business interests, or Carrier is otherwise in breach of any Award, agreement, or purchase order, Niagara shall provide written notice to Carrier outlining the delay and resulting or anticipated harm and/or breach. If the deficiencies and/or breach remain following a period of thirty (30) days from the date written notice was provided, as is measured as of the date specified on the notice, Niagara may terminate any Award, agreement, or purchase order upon thirty (30) days written notice to Carrier.  
e) In the event of any discontinuation and/or revision to any regulations and/or laws in the United States (or any other country where Carrier services Niagara), and/or if Niagara, in its sole discretion, determines that the services contemplated in any Award, agreement, or purchase order are no longer necessary or required and/or that Niagara’s course of business strategy has changed, Niagara may terminate any Award, agreement, or purchase order in part or in its entirety upon sixty (60) days’ notice to Carrier.  
f) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary herein, Niagara shall have the ability to terminate any Award, agreement, or purchase order for convenience with a sixty (60) day written notice, and Carrier shall have the ability to terminate any Award or agreement with one hundred eighty (180) day written notice to Niagara.

**General Provisions**  
a) **Confidentiality**: Throughout the term of any Award, agreement, or purchase order between the Parties, the Parties may come into possession of information or data which constitute trade secrets, know-how, confidential information, or are otherwise considered to be secret (hereinafter “Confidential Information”). In consideration of the receipt of such Confidential Information, Parties agree to maintain such Confidential Information in the utmost of confidence, use such Confidential Information solely in connection with the business relationship established hereunder, and take all measures reasonable and appropriate to protect such Confidential Information.  
b) **Severability**: If any phrase, clause, sentence, or other provision contained in these Standard Carrier T&C’s, or any Award, agreement, or purchase order shall violate any applicable statute, ordinance, rule, or law, are deemed inoperative or unenforceable then the same shall be deemed severed here, to the extent of such violation; provided, however, that the remainder of these Standard Carrier T&C’s, or any Award, agreement, or purchase order shall remain in effect.  
c) **Notices**: Except as specifically provided herein, any notices required hereunder shall become effective when delivered personally or sent by registered mail, certified mail, or overnight courier service to the Parties at their respective addresses.

Philadelphia Street, Ontario, California 91761, Attn: Vice President of Legal Affairs and via email to panderson@niagarawater.com.  
d) **Anti-Kickback**: Carrier will not make any payment or transfer anything of value, directly or indirectly, to any employee of Niagara. It is the intent of the parties that no payments or transfers of anything of value shall be made which may have the purpose or effect (real or perceived) of bribery, acceptance of or acquiescence in kickbacks or other improper means of obtaining business.  
e) **Inspection**: Upon request by Niagara, any duly authorized representative of Niagara shall, until two (2) years after final payment under an Award, agreement, or purchase order between the Parties, have access to and right to examine directly pertinent books, papers, documents, accounts, and records of Carrier involving transactions between the Parties.  
f) **Independent Contractor**: Carrier shall act as an independent contractor and not as an agent or employee of Niagara.  
g) **Mitigation of Damages**: In the event that Carrier is unable to perform any obligation, in whole or in part, under any Award, agreement, or purchase order between the Parties, Niagara shall be entitled to purchase the requisite Transportation Services from another available source and Carrier will be liable for any additional costs incurred by Niagara.  
h) **Force Majeure**: In the event of storms, acts of God, riots, civil insurrection, flood, strike, war, or any other force majeure event that reduces or otherwise limits Carrier’s Transportation Service or delivery capabilities, Carrier shall use best efforts to meet its commitments to Niagara in accordance with any Award, agreement, or purchase order.  
i) These Standard Carrier T&C’s and/or any Award, agreement, or purchase order shall exclusively govern any relationship between Niagara and Carrier. To the extent that there is any conflict between these Standard Carrier T&C’s and/or any Award, agreement, or purchase order, these Standard Carrier T&C’s shall control. Any additional or contrary terms set forth in any of the Parties’ purchase orders, bills of lading, invoices, or other documentation shall have no force or effect.  
j) **Applicable Law**: These Standard Carrier T&C’s and/or any Award, agreement, or purchase order shall be interpreted under the laws of the State of California. Any action arising out of or related to these Standard Carrier T&C’s and/or any Award, agreement, or purchase order between the Parties or any of the dealings between the Parties hereto shall be brought and venued in the State or Federal courts located in San Bernardino County, California.  
k) **Dispute Resolution**: In the event of any dispute arising out of or related to these Standard Carrier T&C’s and/or any Award, agreement, or purchase order between the Parties, the Parties shall make a good faith effort, within thirty (30) days of such dispute, to meet in person to discuss potential amicable resolution of this dispute. During this time, where the Parties are exploring resolution of the dispute, Niagara shall not be in breach due to nonpayment of any invoice. This provision shall not be interpreted to release, postpone, or alter any of Carrier’s obligations set forth herein.  
l) **Attorneys’ Fees**: In the event a dispute cannot be resolved with respect to these Standard Carrier T&C’s and/or any Award, agreement, or purchase order between the Parties or the Transportation Services contemplated herein, the prevailing Party in such dispute shall be entitled to recover all actual and reasonable expenses including, without limitation, reasonable attorneys’ fees and expenses incurred in ascertaining such Party’s rights in preparing to enforce, or enforcing such Party’s rights under these Standard Carrier T&C’s and/or any Award, agreement, or purchase, whether or not it was necessary for such party to institute a suit in a court of law.

**Accessorial Terms**  
The following shall apply to all Awards and agreements between the Parties for Transportation Services:  
a) **On-Time Requirement**: In the event that Carrier’s driver arrives between the window of thirty (30) minutes before or thirty (30) minutes after any pick-up appointment, Niagara shall check-in and Load Carrier’s trailer. If Carrier’s driver arrives between the window of thirty-one (31) minutes to two (2) hours after any pick-up appointment, no accessorial charges or fees will be owed by Niagara, and Niagara will make commercially reasonable efforts to check-in and Load Carrier’s trailer. In the event that Carrier’s driver arrives to any pick-up appointment over two (2) hours late, no accessorial charges or fees will be paid by Niagara to Carrier, and Niagara may, at its sole discretion, reject and not Load the trailer, and assess no-show charges against Carrier.  
b) **Free Wait Time**: Two (2) hours of free waiting time will be honored by the Carrier at both origin and destination.  
c) **Detention Rates**: Niagara shall pay detention rates for pick-up from Niagara facility or delivery to Niagara’s customer at a rate not to exceed $50/hour after two (2) hours of free waiting time, which shall not exceed a total of $250.00 per day. Detention rates on all invoices must correspond with Niagara’s BOL in and out times and be evidenced by both in and out times and show the location in which the charges were accrued.

Total compensation (including regular pay, overtime, bonuses, holidays, tuition, benefits, etc.) for all of 2023 was approximately $21.7 million. Collectively, the facilities are expected to generate over $7.9 million in annual tax revenues for the City of Dallas.

### Local Impact
These data points reflect the broader local impacts of Niagara’s project and investment in the community, beyond the figures listed above. This includes projected community-wide economic impacts, induced local job creation, and an estimated increase in local taxes paid, as calculated from standardized development models.

### Who We Are
Niagara Bottling has been family-owned and operated since 1963. Headquartered in Diamond Bar, California, Niagara operates bottling facilities throughout the U.S. and Mexico. As a leading beverage manufacturer in the U.S., Niagara Bottling works closely with some of the largest beverage brands, retailers, grocers, and club and convenience stores throughout the country. Niagara produces a variety of beverages including bottled water, sparkling, vitamin and flavored water, teas, sports drinks, ready-to-drink coffee, protein drinks, and non-dairy milk products.

At Niagara, we are committed to making a positive impact on society and our communities. As part of this commitment, our local teams place an emphasis on supporting areas of education, emergency needs, community beautification, environment, and health and wellness. We are proud to partner with community leaders and charitable organizations that are making a meaningful difference in the world and in the areas where our facilities are located.

### Drummers & Donations
Team Members from our Dallas plants donated water to the Crowley High School Band.

### Our Focus on Sustainability
Niagara is committed to responsible resource usage and integrating sustainability into every aspect of our business. Niagara not only supports environmental initiatives but also innovation and leadership in their product, packaging, and manufacturing, while promoting consumer awareness and action on sustainability issues. Here’s how Niagara is prioritizing sustainability:

**Water Stewardship:** A standard Niagara facility uses less water to produce its products than it takes to keep a few golf courses green. Niagara typically pays volumetric fees for the water it uses and millions in taxes and fees to municipal systems that enable them to maintain and improve their infrastructure.

**Packaging Efficiency:** Niagara uses less plastic for its bottles than its competitors, and innovations such as lightweight shrink film and corrugate-free nested packs create reductions in CO2 across our product lifecycle.

**Minimizing Environmental Impact:** Niagara PET bottles have a lower environmental impact across most impact categories when compared to other common beverage and water packaging types. Our half-liter bottles have an embodied carbon footprint that is substantially below the U.S. average.

**Recycling Infrastructure and Education:** Niagara supports recycling education through the International Bottled Water Association’s “Put it in the Bin” campaign.

Mesa partnered with the Arbor Day Foundation with the help of the local non-profit organization, Arizona Sustainability Alliance, to help plant nearly 40 trees and shrubs at Sunridge Park in Phoenix in March 2024. Team Members from Mesa and Phoenix volunteered in the effort, aiming to address heat disparity and improve tree equity to benefit the community. Sunridge Park, a public park in southwest Phoenix, was chosen for its potential to equitably distribute trees throughout the neighborhood. The team planted a mix of native and non-native trees and shrubs, all of which are desert-adapted and drought-tolerant. This partnership and tree planting highlights our commitment to beautifying neighborhoods, bringing in fresh air, reducing carbon emissions, and increasing canopy cover.

Niagara plans to construct a new, highly automated manufacturing facility in Kenton County, located in the city of Elsmere, Kentucky, beginning in late 2024. The project will be located at the C5 Airport East Logistics Center. The 52-acre site was developed by CORE5 Industrial Partners and supported by state and local officials. The facility will be the company’s first location in Kentucky. The BE-NKY Growth Partnership was instrumental in facilitating site selection for the project.

The new facility will include 436,800 square feet of advanced manufacturing space, including beverage production and distribution operations. It will utilize state-of-the-art equipment and technology focused on environmental efficiency and sustainability. Niagara’s capital investment is anticipated to be over $120 million when the project is completed. In addition to utility fees, the project is also anticipated to generate over $300,000 in local property tax revenues annually.

Total employment is estimated to be 60 full-time positions with an initial annual payroll of approximately $5.6 million, including important benefits such as retirement and medical insurance, in addition to bonuses and overtime compensation. Niagara offers significant job training opportunities and formal professional development programs, supporting promotions and career advancements from within.

Here’s how Niagara is putting sustainability first:

- **Packaging Efficiency:** Niagara uses the least amount of plastic for its bottles.

- **Lowest Environmental Impact:** Niagara PET bottles have a lower environmental impact across most impact categories when compared to other common beverage and water packaging types. Our half-liter bottles have an embodied carbon footprint that is 46% below the U.S. average.

Niagara Bottling, LLC (hereinafter referred to as “Niagara”) hereby limits acceptance of all Awards, agreements, purchase orders, and any and all bids of Niagara’s business to Carrier’s strict acceptance of the terms and conditions as set forth herein (“Standard Carrier T&C’s”). These Standard Carrier T&C’s, all Awards, agreements, purchase orders, and any and all bids for Niagara’s business shall inure to the benefit of Niagara and any of its affiliates that elect to participate in the Transportation Services (as defined below) hereunder.

Hereinafter, “Broker” and “Carrier” shall collectively be referred to as “Carrier.” “Lanes” shall mean movement of a load from Niagara’s facility to Niagara’s customer’s facility, as specified by Niagara. “Load” shall mean a single truckload. “Transportation Services” shall mean motor carrier services provided by Carrier for the transport, hauling, or delivery of any commodity, including finished products, pallets, or Loads. “Award” shall mean a document from Niagara to Carrier, signed by Carrier notifying Carrier of any Lane or Load awarded to Carrier, and Carrier’s acceptance of such an award. “Party” or “Parties” shall mean Niagara or Carrier individually or collectively.

**Pricing**  
During the term as set forth by Niagara in its sole discretion, as described in any Award or agreement, Carrier agrees only to charge the rates set forth by Niagara (“Base Rate”) for the Transportation Services in Lanes and/or Loads as requested by Niagara as full and complete compensation for the Transportation Services being provided by Carrier. Should Niagara provide an Award to Carrier for additional Lanes and/or Loads to provide Transportation Services to, such additional Award will be subject to these Standard Carrier T&C’s.

**Payment Terms**  
Prior to the commencement of Transportation Services, and in order to receive payment from Niagara, Carrier must provide Niagara with a Certificate of Insurance (COI) in accordance with Section 16 herein. Carrier shall only invoice Niagara for awarded Lanes and/or Loads received from Niagara. Such invoice and all supporting documents shall be submitted promptly, following the transport of any Load to Niagara via email at truckingbackup@niagarawater.com. Such invoices must include Carrier’s name and invoice number in the subject line. Each email shall only include one (1) invoice per email submission. Failure to comply with the terms of this section shall result in delay and/or non-payment of charges. Niagara will pay any undisputed portion of Carrier’s properly submitted invoice within thirty (30) days of receipt of invoice and supporting documentation. Any and all payments by Niagara shall be deemed effective as of the date of postmark. Niagara shall have no liability for invoices that are not received within ninety (90) days of transport of any Load. Niagara shall have no liability for added, balance due, accessorial, or any other charges of any nature which are not provided by the Award and which are not submitted within ninety (90) days from the date of transport of a Load. Carrier agrees to apply payment to the amount due for the specified invoice regardless of whether there are earlier unpaid invoices. In the event any payment becomes overdue, Carrier shall provide written notice of nonpayment via certified mail to: Attn: Vice President of Legal Affairs, Niagara Bottling, LLC, 2560 E. Philadelphia Street, Ontario, California 91761. Carrier shall also notify Niagara by sending emails to the following: Debra Morrison at dmorrison@niagarawater.com and transprocurement@niagarawater.com. Upon actual receipt of certified mail notice, Niagara shall have ten (10) days to cure any late payment. At no time during this cure period will Niagara be deemed in breach. In the event of timely cure by Niagara, Niagara shall not be deemed in breach and shall not be charged any late charges, late fees, penalties, or interest. In no event shall Carrier have a lien on any of Niagara’s Loads, products, or finished goods to secure payment of any invoices or charges. Carrier agrees to comply with all technological requirements of Niagara and its customers, including but not limited to 100% transactional compliance and specifically 204-Load Tender, 210-Carrier Invoice, 214-Shipment Status, and 990-Load Tender Response. Carrier shall be solely responsible for any and all costs for and associated with such technology.

**Award Acceptance**  
Once Carrier signs and accepts any Award, Carrier agrees to transport a minimum of 99% of any tender offers for such Lane(s). If Carrier falls below this 99% threshold, Carrier agrees to be liable for all damages arising due to Carrier’s failure, plus a fee equal to 4% of Carrier’s Base Rate. Such damages include, but are not limited to, costs incurred by Niagara in excess of the Base Rate to secure delivery of any Loads described in such tender offer by a third-party carrier. Should Niagara subsequently offer tenders for Loads not included in the Award or agreement and Carrier agrees to transport such Loads, Carrier agrees to transport such Load at the same rates as the delivery of Loads in the Award unless otherwise agreed to in writing by the Parties. Carrier must notify Niagara within ninety (90) minutes of receipt of Niagara’s tender offer that Carrier has: (a) received the tender offer; and (b) confirmed that it will transport the Load.

**Carrier Performance**  
Carrier understands that all Transportation Services must be performed in a timely fashion. Carrier is solely responsible for scheduling and complying with any and all deliveries and delivery times as requested by Niagara’s customers.  
a) **Pick-up of Loads**: Carrier shall maintain a monthly on-time pick-up appointment rate of a minimum of 90% from the designated Niagara facility through the entire term of the Award. If Carrier’s monthly pick-up rate falls below 90%, Carrier agrees to a $50 fee for every late pick-up appointment for the previous month that caused Carrier to fall below the 90% pick-up rate.  
b) **Delivery of Loads**: Carrier shall maintain a 98% monthly rate for on-time delivery of Loads through the entire term of the Award. On-time delivery of Loads shall mean Loads delivered within thirty (30) minutes of a scheduled delivery appointment time. If Carrier’s monthly on-time delivery rate to Niagara or its customer’s locations falls below 98%, Carrier agrees to a $100 fee for every late and/or missed delivery appointment for the previous month that caused Carrier to fall below the 98% delivery rate.  
c) **Payload**: Carrier warrants that it has the ability to ship Loads that are 45,600 pounds or less. Niagara may scale and weigh all Loads and shall provide a pallet count for all Loads. In accepting any Load, Carrier agrees to count all pallet quantities prior to sealing the trailer. Niagara will make its best effort to produce a tactical forecast of the projected volume of Loads and weights for the upcoming month. In the event Niagara requests Carrier to haul 20% more of its projected daily volume, Carrier shall comply with such a request. In the event Carrier is unable to haul Niagara’s scale and weighted Load, causing Niagara to remove any products or pallets, Carrier agrees that Niagara may deduct a fee of $100 per occurrence from Carrier’s corresponding purchase order.  
d) **Equipment**: Carrier shall ensure that all equipment used in connection with performing Transportation Services be clean, odor-free, dry, leak-proof, and free of contamination and/or infestation. Carrier warrants that no motor vehicle, trailer, tractor, or other equipment that will be used for Transportation Services for Niagara has been used to transport refuse, garbage, trash, or solid or liquid waste of any kind, or any types of hazardous materials. Carrier agrees that any breach of this provision may result in substantial harm to Niagara’s products and/or customers and may have a detrimental effect on Niagara’s reputation and image in the marketplace, product integrity, and goodwill. Niagara may, at its sole discretion, reject any and all trailers for issues including, but not limited to, odors, debris from prior shipment, or lack of structural integrity. Carriers shall not be permitted more than a 1% trailer rejection rate per month.  
e) **Operation**: Carrier shall ensure and bear all costs and expenses related to the operation of its motor vehicles, trailers, tractors, and equipment (“Carrier Equipment”), including ensuring that only fully qualified and licensed personnel operate any Carrier Equipment in accordance with, or as required by all applicable local, state, and/or federal laws, regulations, and authorities.  
f) **Customer Service**: Carrier, at its sole expense, must maintain and make available a telephone line for customer service to Niagara. Such customer service line will be operational twenty-four hours a day, seven days a week, and shall respond within thirty (30) minutes of contact by Niagara.

**Documentation**  
With respect to the following documents, Carrier agrees to maintain the documents as follows:  
a) **Daily reports**: Carrier shall provide Niagara daily reports regarding the status of all Loads and delivery times;  
b) **Proof of Delivery (POD)**: Carrier shall provide Niagara free of charge with any and all PODs within 48 hours of delivery of any Load and shall maintain all such PODs for at least twelve (12) months from the date of delivery, or for a period as proscribed by law;  
c) **Bill of Lading (BOL)**: Carrier agrees that Niagara’s bill of lading shall be considered: (i) an acceptable form of receipt hereunder, and (ii) specific shipping instructions. These Standard Carrier T&C’s shall be incorporated by reference into each and every such BOL and in the event of an inconsistency, these Standard Carrier T&C’s shall control; and  
d) **Supporting documents for Accessorial charges**: Carrier agrees to provide all documents in accordance with Section 18 of these Standard Terms and Conditions.

**Carrier Failure to provide Proof of Delivery (POD)**  
In the event Carrier fails to provide a POD within 48 hours of delivery, Niagara shall have the right to deduct all amounts paid for Transportation Services or demand payment for the amount of the Transportation Service invoice. Additionally, if Carrier cannot provide the POD within fourteen (14) days of delivery, Niagara may charge Carrier for the cost of any of Niagara’s customer’s invoice for product not paid. Alternatively, if Niagara receives a refusal to pay for a Load from its customer, Niagara will provide Carrier with evidence of customer refusal and proof of loss and shall charge Carrier the cost of the customer’s invoice for the product.

**Assignment and Subcontracting**  
Carrier agrees not to interline, use other motor carriers or brokers, or to use “substituted services” or otherwise assign or subcontract any portion of any Award, agreement, or purchase order without the express written consent of Niagara. If, with the express written permission of Niagara, Carrier elects to use a delivery agent or subcontract the transportation of a Load, Carrier shall be the sole bearer of any costs associated with the delivery agent or subcontractor and agrees to be fully liable for any loss, damage, or delay to transportation of any such Loads while in this third-party carrier’s care, custody, and/or control. Carrier understands and agrees that all payments made by Niagara are conditioned upon Niagara’s receipt of a conditional waiver and release executed by Carrier and an unconditional waiver and release executed by each Additional Party. Carrier agrees to defend, indemnify, and hold Niagara and its customers harmless from any and all claims of any Additional Party for payment. Carrier acknowledges and agrees that Carrier shall remain, at all times, fully liable for all Additional Parties. Carrier warrants that it shall ensure that Additional Parties comply with and adhere to all warranties, representations, obligations, terms, and conditions contained herein.

**Compliance with Law**  
At all times during the Award or agreement term or its relationship with Niagara, Carrier shall comply with all applicable state and federal laws. Additionally, Carrier shall operate all Carrier Equipment in compliance with industry standards and shall maintain and operate the same such that Carrier’s safety rating does not fall below “satisfactory” under the Federal Motor Carrier Safety Administration standards. In the event that Carrier’s safety rating falls below “satisfactory,” Carrier shall notify Niagara immediately, and Niagara will have the immediate right to terminate any Award, agreement, or purchase order upon notice to Carrier.

**Indemnification**  
a) Carrier agrees to indemnify, defend, and hold Niagara, its affiliates, and representatives harmless from and against any and all claims arising out of or related to any Award, agreement, or purchase order and/or Transportation Services that are the subject thereof, including but not limited to: (i) any bodily injury or property damage claims, and any liability, loss, cost, expense, or other damages (including reasonable attorney fees) brought about by any injury of any kind suffered by any person or property as a result of any act, neglect, default, omission of either the Carrier, Carrier’s agents, employees, affiliates, subcontractors, or any third party for whose actions Carrier is responsible (“Carrier Actors”), or Niagara, Niagara’s agents, employees, affiliates, subcontractors, or other representatives; (ii) any negligent act, misfeasance, or nonfeasance by Carrier, or Carrier Actors; (iii) any harm, injury, damage, or loss arising out of or in connection with the Transportation Services provided; (iv) third-party consumer claims, suits, and/or demands, including costs and expenses of investigation and settlement and attorneys’ fees and expenses, to the extent such claims arise from: (a) any act or omission by Carrier or Carrier Actors relating to or affecting the condition, quality, or character of any Goods or Services provided; or (b) trademark, copyright, trade dress, or patent infringement. Carrier acknowledges and agrees that Carrier must receive Niagara’s express written approval prior to settling any claim or lawsuit. Niagara reserves the right at any time to control its own defense.  
b) Should Carrier receive (or become aware of) any demand, service of process, notice, action, settlement, summons, complaint, or the like from or by a third party alleging that a Party hereto is responsible for some injury, act, omission, breach, negligence, claim, loss, violation of law, settlement, cost, expense, obligation, liability, damage, recovery, deficiency, or otherwise, including, without limitation, interest, penalties, reasonable attorney fees, and costs (each, a “Claim”) that arises out of, results from, or in any way relates to the subject matter of these Standard Terms and Conditions, an Award, agreement, or purchase order, then Carrier shall immediately (but no later than five (5) business days after receipt, or becoming aware, of a third-party Claim) provide Niagara with written notice regarding each third-party Claim of which Carrier is or becomes aware. Carrier covenants and agrees that should Carrier fail to provide Niagara with timely written notice regarding any third-party Claim, Carrier hereby generally and expressly waives, relinquishes, and releases, and agrees to hold harmless, Niagara from and against any and all Claims capable of being asserted by Carrier against Niagara in connection therewith.  
c) In the event Carrier utilizes any party (“Additional Party”) regardless of that party’s legal designation of contractor, subcontractor, materials supplier, agent, or otherwise, for the purpose of performing any Transportation Services, Carrier shall submit to Niagara written notice of (i) each Additional Party, (ii) the duties each Additional Party will undertake, (iii) the amount of compensation each Additional Party is to receive from Carrier, and (iv) Carrier’s compensation schedule and payment terms with the Additional Party. Carrier understands that submitting this written notice as set forth above is a condition precedent to payment. Such written notice must be sent to the Vice President of Legal Affairs via email and certified mail (1) panderson@niagarawater.com, (2) 2560 E. Philadelphia St., Ontario, CA 91761.  
g) **Waiver**: Niagara’s delay, failure, or partial exercise of any provision herein or waiver of any breach, right, or remedy contained in or granted by any Award, agreement, or purchase order shall not be deemed a waiver of any breach, right, or remedy unless expressly stated as such by Niagara in writing signed by an authorized representative of Niagara, and then such waiver shall be limited solely to its specific terms.

**Limitation of Liability**  
In no event shall Niagara be liable for any punitive, exemplary, special, incidental, indirect, or consequential damages of any kind (including, but not limited to loss of profits, loss of reputation, and/or loss of current or prospective business advantage, when where such losses are characterized as direct damages) arising out of or in any way related to the relationship and/or dealings between Niagara and Carrier regardless of whether the claim under which damages are sought is based upon contract, tort, negligence, strict liability, or otherwise, and regardless of whether the parties have been advised of the possibility of such damages at the time of contracting or otherwise. Under no circumstances shall Niagara’s maximum total liability, if any, arising out of or in any way related to the relationship and/or dealings between Niagara and Carrier exceed the amounts paid and/or due to Carrier by Niagara under any relationship between the Parties, Award, agreement, or purchase order.

**Liability for Loss, Damage, or Delay to Loads**  
a) Carrier agrees that in the transportation of all Loads hereunder, it shall assume, and does assume, the liability of an interstate motor carrier, as provided by 49 U.S.C. § 14706, with such liability to exist from the time of the receipt of any of said goods by Carrier until proper delivery has been made to the location specified by Niagara. The Parties expressly decline to limit the value of the property as permitted by 49 U.S.C. § 14706(c). All claims will be filed and resolved in accordance with the ICC regulations in 49 CFR Part 370.  
b) All Loads tendered to Carrier for transportation will be palletized and stretch-wrapped. Carrier reserves the right to refuse to accept any Load that is not so packaged.  
c) Parties agree that each incident of transportation of product under any Award, agreement, or purchase order shall be evidenced by a BOL signed by Carrier and Niagara showing the kind, quantity, value, and condition of products or goods received and delivered by Carrier at the loading and unloading points respectively. Carrier’s duties and responsibilities under any Award, agreement, or purchase order between the Parties for the transport of any Load evidenced by such receipt shall commence when Carrier takes possession and control of Niagara’s property or upon execution of such receipt by Niagara, whichever occurs first, and shall end when consignee/customer/buyer signs a delivery receipt and Carrier delivers Niagara’s property. Carrier shall inspect all Loads prior to accepting possession and control and shall document any evidence of damage on the BOL. If Carrier does not indicate damage on the BOL at the time of possession and immediately communicates the existence of such damage to Niagara, Carrier agrees that damage documented upon delivery presumptively occurred while the Load was in Carrier’s custody and possession.  
d) The time limit within which Niagara must file a claim for damaged or lost products or goods against Carrier shall be nine (9) months from the date of delivery or within nine (9) months of the reasonably anticipated date of delivery in the event of a complete loss. All claims shall be paid, settled, or disallowed by Carrier within ninety (90) days of filing. Disallowance shall state a lawful reason for declining to accept responsibility for the claim and shall be stated by Carrier, not its insurer. In no event shall Niagara be required to work with Carrier’s insurer directly. Niagara agrees to immediately provide written notice of claim to Carrier showing kind, quantity, value, and proof of carriage as evidenced by a signed BOL.

**Product Loss or Damage**  
a) **Rejected Load**: In the event the Niagara’s customer rejects the delivery of any Load due to the fault of Carrier, Carrier must return the Load to the pick-up origin designated by Niagara at no cost. In the event Niagara’s customer rejects the delivery of a Load due to no fault of the Carrier, Niagara shall pay a transportation rate equal to the rate Niagara paid Carrier to transport the Load to Niagara’s customer. Any and all rejected Loads not scheduled for redelivery must be delivered back to Niagara’s pick-up origin within five (5) days from the time/date of initial pick-up. Any Load being transported back to Niagara’s pick-up origin must be secured with either a seal or padlock and a confirmation must be sent via email to executionteam@niagarawater.com. Return charges for short-haul clusters will be returned at half the published rate of the Load. For long-haul cluster freight, return charges will not exceed the total all-in rate of the Load.  
b) **Visual Damage to Products**: For damages to individual cases of product up to less than one pallet, Niagara’s customer must note the damage on the BOL, and the customer or Carrier may dispose of or donate damaged cases of product. For damage to one or more pallets, Niagara’s customer must note the damage on the BOL. If the Load is rejected and remains in the custody of Carrier, Carrier must immediately contact Niagara Dispatch for deposition instructions. Carrier must provide the purchase order number, date and time of single delivery, number of pallets damaged and/or refused, bottle code, any photographs, a brief description of the damage, and contact information, including contact name, phone number, email, and facsimile number.  
c) **Concealed Damage to Products**: If Niagara’s customer reports concealed damage to the product, pallet, and/or Load, such damage will be investigated to determine liability. If the investigation concludes that Carrier is responsible for the damage, Carrier will be notified of Niagara’s intent to file a claim and will be given the opportunity to inspect the product, pallet, or Load prior to disposition for disposal or donation.  
d) **Product Loss/Delay**: In the event Carrier is unable to execute delivery for reasons such as theft of Load, vehicular accident, or delay impacting the product’s integrity (i.e., non-delivery of Load/products to its specified destination within five (5) calendar days), recovery of loss will be executed pursuant to 49 CFR 370.  
e) **Donation/Disposal**: Due to product liability, trademark protection, and/or licensing agreements for private label stock, any distressed, damaged, or otherwise rejected shipment that is not returned to a Niagara facility, for whatever reason, must be properly disposed of or donated in accordance with Niagara’s express written instruction. IN NO CIRCUMSTANCE CAN ANY GOODS, PRODUCTS, OR INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY EVER BE RE-SOLD. Carrier understands and agrees that in no event shall Carrier nor any Carrier Actors, without the prior express written consent of Niagara: (i) cause, suffer, or permit the transfer, salvage, disposal, and/or donation of any Goods, Products, or Intellectual Property, and/or (ii) offer to transfer, salvage, dispose of, and/or donate any Goods, Products, or Intellectual Property, whether as salvage or otherwise. Notwithstanding the foregoing, if there is a distressed, damaged, or otherwise rejected Load of product that is not returned to a Niagara facility, and Niagara gives express written permission to a Carrier to dispose of or donate the goods or products, Niagara shall require written verification, signed by the Carrier’s authorized agent, which provides exact details as to the final disposition as well as copies of donation/disposal receipts as backup.  
f) **Claim Settlement**: In order to close a freight claim as settled, one of the following conclusions must be obtained:  
- Granted: paid in full  
- Declined: written declination including a specific legal reason  
- Compromised: written offer to settle for less than the original claim amount, including legal rationale for the offer to pay less than the full amount claimed  

g) **Payment**: Any and all payments from Carrier to Niagara in settlement of a claim must be made, in full, and sent to: Niagara Bottling, LLC, 2560 E. Philadelphia Street, Ontario, CA 91761, Attention: Claims Specialist. Niagara’s claim reference number must appear on the check. A partial payment check will not be accepted and will not be cashed as a granted or settled claim.

**Seals**  
Carrier agrees to comply with the Food and Drug Administration and industry standards with regard to seals as codified in FDA 21 CFR 110.93, which states that all transportation of food shall be under conditions to protect that food. Storage and transportation of finished food shall be under conditions that will protect the food against physical, chemical, and microbial contamination as well as against deterioration of the food and the container. Carrier further agrees to use standard industry practices, including, but not limited to ensuring that any and all trailers from or on behalf of Niagara will be kept sealed while transporting all goods. Carrier must confirm that the seal has been secured on the trailer and that the seal number is recorded on the BOL by Niagara prior to leaving any of Niagara’s facilities. If the seal is required to be broken at any time during transport, Carrier must first seek Niagara’s authorization. Carrier must then notify Niagara that the trailer has been re-sealed by sending an email to executionteam@niagarawater.com. In the event Niagara’s customer breaks the seal, rejects the Load, and does not provide Carrier with a new seal to re-seal the trailer, Niagara’s customer or Carrier must add a lock to the trailer to secure the Load. It is Carrier’s sole responsibility to ensure that the trailer is re-sealed or a lock is added to the trailer prior to leaving Niagara’s customer’s facilities. No Loads will be accepted by Niagara without a seal or lock on the trailer.

**Insurance**  
During the term of all Awards, agreements, or purchase orders, and after any termination of or expiration, and for as long as Carrier owes any obligation to Niagara and/or any statute of limitations for any potential claim that Niagara may have against Carrier remains unexpired, Carrier and any Carrier Actors shall maintain all insurance and/or bonds required by statute, law, and any Award, agreement, or purchase order with minimum insurance limits consistent with Niagara’s insurance requirements set forth at the end of this Section 16. Should insurance policy limits be exhausted or should Carrier or any Carrier Actors fail to maintain the required insurance coverage, neither Carrier nor any Carrier Actor will in any way be relieved from liability provided for herein to Niagara should a loss occur. Carrier shall furnish Niagara with a certificate evidencing the aforementioned coverage limits via email to insurancecerts@niagarawater.com. Such certificate shall provide for thirty (30) days written notice to Niagara in the event of cancellation. All certificates of insurance shall name Niagara Bottling, LLC and its parents, subsidiaries, employees, agents, affiliates, and assigns as an additional insured by policy endorsement (on both Carrier’s General Liability Policy, Automobile Liability Policy, and Cargo Insurance Policy) and waive all rights of subrogation against Niagara, its parent, director, officers, employees, stockholders, subsidiaries, and affiliates with regard to Employee Liability and Workers Compensation. For any claims relating to an Agreement, agreement, or purchase order, the Carrier’s insurance shall be deemed to be primary and not contributing to or in excess of any similar coverage purchased by Niagara. Carrier hereby acknowledges that naming Niagara Bottling, LLC and its parents, subsidiaries, employees, agents, affiliates, and assigns as an additional insured by policy endorsement is a condition precedent to payment by Niagara. For the avoidance of doubt, Niagara will not be required to submit payment until the requirements of this provision have been met. However, failure of Niagara to demand any certificates or to identify any deficiency in the insurance provided shall not be construed as or deemed to be a waiver of the Carrier’s (or its agents or subcontractors) obligation to maintain such insurance. If any of the coverages are required to remain in force after termination of the Agreement, Carrier shall submit additional certificates evidencing continuation of coverage until such obligation ends.  

**Niagara’s Minimum Insurance Requirements**:  
- Commercial General Liability: $2,000,000 per occurrence; $5,000,000 aggregate  
- Auto Liability: $3,000,000 combined single limit  
- Cargo: $100,000  
- Employee Liability/Workman’s Comp: $2,000,000/Statutory  

In addition to the general insurance requirements provided in the above table, customized insurance requirements for specific Seller-types are attached hereto and incorporated herein by this reference.

**Termination**  
a) Any Award, agreement, or purchase order shall commence on the date such Award is given, agreement is entered into, or purchase order is issued, and shall automatically renew on a year-to-year basis until terminated, provided that Carrier is performing in accordance with these Carrier Standard T&C’s, the Award, agreement, or purchase order, and that Carrier continues to provide Niagara the lowest available rates in the market and the lowest rates and/or most favorable terms at which Carrier offers its service to any third-party shipper in the same functional level of the trade as Niagara (“Most Favorable Rates”). The Parties agree to meet in good faith to discuss existing rates at a time no earlier than twelve (12) months after the Award is issued or an agreement is entered into by the Parties. Such discussions may result in a rate adjustment if, and only if, the adjustment is in reference to driver pay, and only upon mutual written consent by both Parties. Notwithstanding the foregoing, Carrier guarantees that any rate increase will not exceed 2% of the current rate. In the event that Carrier does not provide Niagara with the Most Favorable Rates, Niagara shall have the right to terminate by giving thirty (30) days written notice to Carrier.  
b) If during the term specified by any Award, agreement, or purchase order either party (i) files a petition in bankruptcy or has a petition in bankruptcy filed against it that is not dismissed within sixty (60) days, or (ii) makes a general assignment for the benefit of creditors, then in any such case the non-bankrupt party may terminate any Award, agreement, or purchase order by giving written notice of such effect to the bankrupt party.  
c) If all or any portion of Carrier’s registration, as required by any Award, agreement, or purchase order, is revoked, canceled, suspended, or discontinued by operation of law or otherwise (“Registration Issue”), or if Carrier’s insurance policies are canceled, reduced, or otherwise invalidated (“Insurance Issue”), Carrier shall promptly notify Niagara, and in no case later than forty-eight (48) hours after Carrier learns of any such Registration or Insurance Issue and Niagara shall have the right to terminate any Award, agreement, or purchase order immediately and/or collect reimbursement for all expenses it has incurred in preparation of and/or as a result of any Award, agreement, or purchase order from Carrier. Carrier’s notification to Niagara in regards to the above shall in no way serve as a waiver by Niagara of its right to construe such as a breach of any Award, agreement, or purchase order and shall in no way limit Niagara’s right to pursue all remedies in law or equity as a result of such breach.  
d) If, in Niagara’s sole discretion, delays in transportation cause inconvenience and/or harm to Niagara’s business interests, or Carrier is otherwise in breach of any Award, agreement, or purchase order, Niagara shall provide written notice to Carrier outlining the delay and resulting or anticipated harm and/or breach. If the deficiencies and/or breach remain following a period of thirty (30) days from the date written notice was provided, as is measured as of the date specified on the notice, Niagara may terminate any Award, agreement, or purchase order upon thirty (30) days written notice to Carrier.  
e) In the event of any discontinuation and/or revision to any regulations and/or laws in the United States (or any other country where Carrier services Niagara), and/or if Niagara, in its sole discretion, determines that the services contemplated in any Award, agreement, or purchase order are no longer necessary or required and/or that Niagara’s course of business strategy has changed, Niagara may terminate any Award, agreement, or purchase order in part or in its entirety upon sixty (60) days’ notice to Carrier.  
f) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary herein, Niagara shall have the ability to terminate any Award, agreement, or purchase order for convenience with a sixty (60) day written notice, and Carrier shall have the ability to terminate any Award or agreement with one hundred eighty (180) day written notice to Niagara.

**General Provisions**  
a) **Confidentiality**: Throughout the term of any Award, agreement, or purchase order between the Parties, the Parties may come into possession of information or data which constitute trade secrets, know-how, confidential information, or are otherwise considered to be secret (hereinafter “Confidential Information”). In consideration of the receipt of such Confidential Information, Parties agree to maintain such Confidential Information in the utmost of confidence, use such Confidential Information solely in connection with the business relationship established hereunder, and take all measures reasonable and appropriate to protect such Confidential Information.  
b) **Severability**: If any phrase, clause, sentence, or other provision contained in these Standard Carrier T&C’s, or any Award, agreement, or purchase order shall violate any applicable statute, ordinance, rule, or law, are deemed inoperative or unenforceable then the same shall be deemed severed here, to the extent of such violation; provided, however, that the remainder of these Standard Carrier T&C’s, or any Award, agreement, or purchase order shall remain in effect.  
c) **Notices**: Except as specifically provided herein, any notices required hereunder shall become effective when delivered personally or sent by registered mail, certified mail, or overnight courier service to the Parties at their respective addresses. Notice shall be deemed given upon personal delivery or on the receipt of registered, certified, or overnight mail. Notices to Niagara shall be sent to: Niagara Bottling, LLC, 2560 E. Philadelphia Street, Ontario, California 91761, Attn: Vice President of Legal Affairs and via email to panderson@niagarawater.com.  
d) **Anti-Kickback**: Carrier will not make any payment or transfer anything of value, directly or indirectly, to any employee of Niagara. It is the intent of the parties that no payments or transfers of anything of value shall be made which may have the purpose or effect (real or perceived) of bribery, acceptance of or acquiescence in kickbacks or other improper means of obtaining business.

**Accessorial Terms**  
The following shall apply to all Awards and agreements between the Parties for Transportation Services:  
a) **On-Time Requirement**: In the event that Carrier’s driver arrives between the window of thirty (30) minutes before or thirty (30) minutes after any pick-up appointment, Niagara shall check-in and Load Carrier’s trailer. If Carrier’s driver arrives between the window of thirty-one (31) minutes to two (2) hours after any pick-up appointment, no accessorial charges or fees will be owed by Niagara, and Niagara will make commercially reasonable efforts to check-in and Load Carrier’s trailer. In the event that Carrier’s driver arrives at any pick-up appointment over two (2) hours late, no accessorial charges or fees will be paid by Niagara to Carrier, and Niagara may, at its sole discretion, reject and not Load the trailer, and assess no-show charges against Carrier.  
b) **Free Wait Time**: Two (2) hours of free waiting time will be honored by the Carrier at both origin and destination.

Detention rates on all invoices must correspond with Niagara’s BOL in and out times and be evidenced by both in and out times and show the location in which the charges were accrued. No detention rate shall be owed if Carrier is more than thirty (30) minutes late for its pick-up or delivery appointment.

Release of a trailer shall immediately end all drop trailer detention rate charges to Niagara. Carrier shall invoice Niagara separately for any drop trailer detention rates. Carrier will agree to communicate any potential issue leading to an accessorial charge at the time an incident occurs in order to allow Niagara an opportunity to resolve the issue.

h) **Truck Order Not Used (“TONU”)**: TONU charge shall not exceed $250. In no event will TONU charge exceed the cost of the products being transported. Carrier agrees that it shall not issue any TONU charges if 1) Carrier’s driver leaves the pick-up location on his own accord, 2) if Carrier tells its driver to leave the pick-up location without contacting and coordinating a pick-up appointment with Niagara, or 3) if Carrier’s driver arrives more than thirty (30) minutes after their scheduled pick-up appointment time.  
i) **No Show Charge**: If Carrier fails to pick up a tender that Carrier previously accepted and fails to notify Niagara at least 12 hours prior to the scheduled pick-up time, then Niagara may charge Carrier a no-show charge in the amount of $150 dollars or deduct the same from Carrier’s account with reference to the purchase order number for the tender of the Load.  
j) **Lumper**: If Carrier is prohibited from unloading a trailer and Customer requires the hiring of a Lumper, Niagara agrees to reimburse Carrier for any Lumper, provided Carrier provides the Lumper receipt for the exact amount charged by the lumper service, with no markup, to each invoice referencing the corresponding purchase order number.  
k) **Driver Assist**: If Niagara’s customer is requiring Carrier to unload via driver assist, the charge will not exceed $50 per Load.  
l) **Re-Delivery**: In the event Niagara’s customer rejects or refuses delivery of a Load due to the fault of the Carrier, such as arriving late for the delivery appointment, Carrier must redeliver the Load at no further cost or expense to Niagara. In the event Niagara’s customer rejects or refuses delivery of a Load due to no fault of Carrier, Carrier agrees to redeliver the Load at a cost equal to or less than the cost of initial delivery. Carrier agrees to make every attempt to hold the Load in close proximity to Niagara’s customer’s delivery location.  
m) **Diversion Charges**: In the event that Carrier attempts to deliver to a location as specified by Niagara, and the Load is rejected, Niagara reserves the right to divert Carrier’s driver to another customer location within 150 miles of the original delivery location. Niagara shall pay diversion costs in accordance with the following chart:

| Distance from Original Location in miles | Diversion Rate to be Paid to Carrier (in US Dollars) |
